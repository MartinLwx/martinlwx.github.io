      <description>What are the semantic actions When the parser processes the input code, it not only determines whether the syntax is correct but also performs some useful actions. These actions are called semantic actions. In fact, it is a piece of code, which is generally embedded in the rules of the grammar file. Then when the parser applies this specific rule, the code you set will be executed. From another perspective, semantic actions are actually &amp;ldquo;triggers&amp;rdquo;, and the trigger condition is that the parser applies the corresponding rules.</description>

      <description>Intro I have finished the first two projects - Hog and Cats. The first two projects are relatively simple and uncomplicated. But today, the difficulty of the third project has indeed increased (you can see how complicated this is by looking at the rules of the game). It feels like Plants vs. Zombies
So I&amp;rsquo;m going to write a blog to sort out the ideas when writing code. 🤗
Phase 1: Basic gameplay Problem 1 (1 pt) Part A: Currently, there is no cost for placing any type of Ant, and so there is no challenge to the game.</description>

      <description>Trees Q1: Prune Min Write a function that prunes a Tree t mutatively. t and its branches always have zero or two branches. For the trees with two branches, reduce the number of branches from two to one by keeping the branch that has the smaller label value. Do nothing with trees with zero branches.
Prune the tree in a direction of your choosing (top down or bottom up). The result should be a linear tree.</description>

      <description>BNF Q1: Grouping and Pipes In this question, you will add support for grouping and piping.
Recall that grouping allows for an entire regular expression to be treated as a single unit, and piping allows for a pattern to match an expression on either side. Combined, these will let us create patterns which match multiple strings!
Define the group and pipe expressions in your grammar.
A group consists of any regex expression surrounded by parentheses (()).</description>

      <description>Regular Expressions Q1: Calculator Ops Write a regular expression that parses strings written in the 61A Calculator language and returns any expressions which have two numeric operands, leaving out the parentheses around them.
We need to write a regular expression to match a pattern - (operand operator1 operator2). The operands consist of +, -, *, /. We can use [] here. Don&amp;rsquo;t forget to put a \ in front of - to escape it.</description>

      <description>Q2: Roman Numerals Write a regular expression that finds any string of letters that resemble a Roman numeral and aren&amp;rsquo;t part of another word. A Roman numeral is made up of the letters I, V, X, L, C, D, M and is at least one letter long.
For the purposes of this problem, don&amp;rsquo;t worry about whether or not a Roman numeral is valid. For example, &amp;ldquo;VIIIII&amp;rdquo; is not a Roman numeral, but it is fine if your regex matches it.</description>

      <description>Context Problem 1 Important: Your code for this part should go in buffer.py.
Your job in this part is to implement the current and pop_first methods of the Buffer class.
current should return the current token of the current line we&amp;rsquo;re on in the Buffer instance without removing it. If there are no more tokens in the current line, then current should move onto the next valid line, and return the first token of this line.</description>

      <description>Q1: My Filter Write a procedure my-filter, which takes a predicate func and a list lst, and returns a new list containing only elements of the list that satisfy the predicate. The output should contain the elements in the same order that they appeared in the original list.
Note: Make sure that you are not just calling the built-in filter function in Scheme - we are asking you to re-implement this!</description>

      <description>Q1: Thane of Cadr Define the procedures cadr and caddr, which return the second and third elements of a list, respectively. If you would like a quick refresher on scheme syntax consider looking at Lab 10 Scheme Refresher.
We need to implement the function c???r. To have a better understanding of this notation, you should look from back to the front in ???. For example, the cadr function will call cdr then call car on the input.</description>

      <description>Recursion and Tree Recursion Q1: Subsequences A subsequence of a sequence S is a subset of elements from S, in the same order they appear in S. Consider the list [1, 2, 3]. Here are a few of it&amp;rsquo;s subsequences [], [1, 3], [2], and [1, 2, 3].
Write a function that takes in a list and returns all possible subsequences of that list. The subsequences should be returned as a list of lists, where each nested list is a subsequence of the original input.</description>

Try to find both an iterative and recursive solution for this problem!
It is easy to solve this problem iteratively. All we have to do is to make a list to store these nodes we have visited while we iterating this linklist.</description>

      <description>Accounts Q2: Retirement Add a time_to_retire method to the Account class. This method takes in an amount and returns how many years the holder would need to wait in order for the current balance to grow to at least amount, assuming that the bank adds balance times the interest rate to the total balance at the end of every year.
The description tells us that: We will add our balance every year, so when may we retire?</description>

      <description>Mutability Write a function which takes in a list lst, an argument entry, and another argument elem. This function will check through each item in lst to see if it is equal to entry. Upon finding an item equal to entry, the function should modify the list by placing elem into lst right after the item. At the end of the function, the modified list should be returned.
See the doctests for examples on how this function is utilized.</description>

      <description>Mobiles Q2: Weights Implement the planet data abstraction by completing the planet constructor and the size selector so that a planet is represented using a two-element list where the first element is the string &#39;planet&#39; and the second element is its size.
From the description, we can know what is planet. It is a [&#39;planet&#39;, size]. Then we can take a look at the mobile function, the solution is quite similar.</description>

We can know such a basic mathematical fact: the factor of a number can only be up to half of it (when the number is even). So we use for i in range(1, n // 2 + 1)
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 def factors_list(n): &amp;#34;&amp;#34;&amp;#34;Return a list containing all the numbers that divide `n` evenly, except for the number itself.</description>

      <description>Intro I find it really interesting to solve recursive problems. I like this way of solving problems, the code is concise and intuitive, which is why I wrote this blog.
📒 How to solve a recursive problem ?
What is the base case ? How to break down the current problem into simpler ones ? Later, I will follow this idea to solve the recursion problem in this lab.
Recursion Q2: Summation Write a recursive implementation of summation, which takes a positive integer n and a function term.</description>

      <description>hw03. Recursion, Tree Recursion Q1: Num eights Write a recursive function num_eights that takes a positive integer pos and returns the number of times the digit 8 appears in pos.
Important: Use recursion; the tests will fail if you use any assignment statements. (You can however use function definitions if you so wish.)
It is easy to think of the answer to this question, for we have seen a similar one in lecture.</description>

      <description>hw02. Higher Order Functions Q1: Product The summation(n, term) function from the higher-order functions lecture adds up term(1) + ... + term(n). Write a similar function called product that returns term(1) * ... * term(n).
This problem is quite easy, we just need to use * instead of +. The logic is similar to summation(n, term) function in the lecture.
Remember to set ans = 1 at first, after all, 0 * any numbers is always equal to 0 🤗</description>

This problem is easy if we know that we can bind names to functions. In this problem:
When b &amp;lt; 0, a + abs(b) = a - b, so we should use sub When b &amp;gt; 0, a + abs(b) = a + b, so we should use add 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 def a_plus_abs_b(a, b): &amp;#34;&amp;#34;&amp;#34;Return a+abs(b), but without calling abs.</description>

      <description>Lecture 09. Security and Cryptography Entropy Suppose a password is chosen as a concatenation of four lower-case dictionary words, where each word is selected uniformly at random from a dictionary of size 100,000. An example of such a password is correcthorsebatterystaple. How many bits of entropy does this have?
In order to calculate the bits of entropy, we need to know how many possibilites there.
We can easily know the combinations count are $100000^4$ and the bits of entropy are $log_2 (100000^4)\approx 66\ bit$ 🤗</description>

      <description>Lecture 08. Metaprogramming Most makefiles provide a target called clean. This isn’t intended to produce a file called clean, but instead to clean up any files that can be re-built by make. Think of it as a way to “undo” all of the build steps. Implement a clean target for the paper.pdf Makefile above. You will have to make the target phony. You may find the git ls-filessubcommand useful. A number of other very common make targets are listed here.</description>

Now use pgrep to find its pid and pkill to kill it without ever typing the pid itself.</description>
