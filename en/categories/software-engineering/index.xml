    <description><![CDATA[<h2 id="intro" class="headerLink">
    <a href="#intro" class="header-mark" aria-label="Header mark for 'Intro'"></a>Intro</h2><p>Recently I started learning the GitHub Actions, a feature provided by GitHub that can be used to <em>automate</em> a series of steps. In the process of software development, the most common use of this feature <em>may</em> be the building process. For static-typed programming languages such as C/C++, we are usually required to write the build scripts. The build process involves environment preparation, dependencies download, and build execution. However, <em>automating</em> software builds with GitHub Actions is not the focus of this post. As I was learning this feature, I thought about how I could put it into practice and realized I could use it to <em>automate</em> the build and deployment of my Hugo blog :)</p>]]></description>
