The signature of fmap function in Functor is a -\u003e b -\u003e f a -\u003e f b. So we can only use regular unary function a -\u003e b as a mapping function. What if we want to use a mapping function with multiple arguments? For example, we may want to use (+) :: a -\u003e a -\u003e a as the mapping function, then what we will get? haskell ghci\u003e let a = fmap (+) [1,2,3] ghci\u003e :t a a :: Num a =\u003e [a -\u003e a] Info The Unary function is a function that only has one single argument From the output of ghci, we can see each value in the Functor becomes a function a -\u003e a. Given that every function in Haskell is a currying function, we can figure out how it works. Each value in the List Functor becomes the first argument of (+). You may imagine the List Functor will be haskell [\\x -\u003e 1 + x, \\x -\u003e 2 + x, \\x -\u003e 3 + x] -- or, more simpler [(1+), (2+), (3+)] So we should have no problem using 1 as the second argument of (+). haskell ghci\u003e fmap ($ 1) a [2,3,4] -- 2 = 1 + 1 -- 3 = 2 + 1 -- 4 = 3 + 1 Note Conclusion: If the mapping function f contains two arguments, then fmap f x will make each value within Functor x become a function. If you understand the above example, I’m sure that you know how to get Just (1+) using fmap haskell ghci\u003e let justF = fmap (+) $ Just 1 ghci\u003e :t justF justF :: Num a =\u003e Maybe (a -\u003e a) Now imagine that we have a value of Just 2 haskell ghci\u003e :t Just 2 Just 2 :: Num a =\u003e Maybe a Then, can we combine Just (1+) and Just 2 somehow and get Just (1+2) = Just 3? After all, it should be a natural thing to do. You will find that we can’t directly use fmap to achieve this. The reason is that the fmap can only use a regular unary function a -\u003e b as the mapping function. However, the function now lives in a Functor (that is, Maybe (a -\u003e a) instead of a -\u003e a). If such an operator exists (denoted as magicOperator), we can derive its signature haskell magicOperator :: Maybe (a -\u003e b) -\u003e Maybe a -\u003e Maybe b If we abstract Maybe with a general type constructor f haskell magicOperator :: f (a -\u003e b) -\u003e f a -\u003e f b Congratulations! You just derive the \u003c*\u003e operator in Applicative Functor. Tip Although we can’t use fmap directly here, we can combine it with pattern matching to achieve the same goal. haskell apply Nothing _ = Nothing apply (Just f) Nothing = Nothing apply (Just f) (Just v) = fmap f (Just v) However, other Functor types don’t necessarily support extraction using pattern matching like this :( Previously, we only considered the scenario where the mapping function has one argument. Now let’s consider the scenario with n arguments. Let the mapping function be represented as g, and its type signature is haskell g :: t1 -\u003e t2 -\u003e t3 -\u003e ... -\u003e tn -\u003e t Let’s assume that we have a bunch of Functors xi, where each xi has the type f ti. Since Haskell functions are all curried, we can start by deriving from fmap g x1 haskell -- Note that -- 1. fmap :: (a -\u003e b) -\u003e f a -\u003e f b -- 2. g :: t1 -\u003e t2 -\u003e t3 -\u003e ... -\u003e tn -\u003e t -- 3. x1 :: f t1 fmap g x1 :: f (t2 -\u003e t3 -\u003e ... -\u003e tn -\u003e t) Let’s continue to derive the type of fmap g x1 x2. And we will be stuck here because the types just don’t match! haskell fmap g x1 :: f (t2 -\u003e t3 -\u003e ... -\u003e tn -\u003e t) x2 :: f t2 Apparently, we should use \u003c*\u003e here, and the equation should be like haskell fmap g x1 \u003c*\u003e x2 \u003c*\u003e x3 \u003c*\u003e x4 \u003c*\u003e ... \u003c*\u003e xn -- or, more simpler g \u003c$\u003e x1 \u003c*\u003e x2 \u003c*\u003e x3 \u003c*\u003e x4 \u003c*\u003e ... \u003c*\u003e xn Note Conclusion: We need the Applicative Functor because we need to use \u003c*\u003e to apply a function within a Functor on a value within another Functor.

The type a -\u003e f a indicates that the pure function just put a value a into the Applicative Functor. The most intuitive application may be putting a function into an Applicative Functor. In the aforementioned example, we have haskell fmap g x1 \u003c*\u003e x2 \u003c*\u003e x3 \u003c*\u003e x4 \u003c*\u003e ... \u003c*\u003e xn -- or, more simpler g \u003c$\u003e x1 \u003c*\u003e x2 \u003c*\u003e x3 \u003c*\u003e x4 \u003c*\u003e ... \u003c*\u003e xn We can use the pure function and rewrite the equation. haskell pure g \u003c*\u003e x1 \u003c*\u003e x2 \u003c*\u003e x3 \u003c*\u003e x4 \u003c*\u003e ... \u003c*\u003e xn The \u003c*\u003e was derived earlier by ourselves, and its meaning is already clear, so we won’t go into detail here.

For each programming language, there is a GitHub repository called tree-sitter-*, where * represents the programming language. For example, Python’s corresponding GitHub repository is tree-sitter-python. You may find a specific file called grammar.js in such a repository. This file defines the grammar of the programming language. Let’s take tree-sitter-python for an example, the grammar shows the syntax of for-loop is js for_statement: $ =\u003e seq( optional('async'), 'for', field('left', $._left_hand_side), 'in', field('right', $._expressions), ':', field('body', $._suite), field('alternative', optional($.else_clause)), ), If you have some compiler background, it’s easy to infer the syntax of for-loop in Python is python [async] for \u003cleft\u003e in \u003cright\u003e: \u003cbody\u003e [\u003celse_clause\u003e] Tip The [] means it’s optional, and the \u003c\u003e means they can be further expanded. After knowing how the AST is defined, we want to know how to generate an AST for a code snippet using the parser produced by Tree-sitter. We can install tree-sitter in the local machine. If you are using the Mac, you can use homebrew sh $ brew install tree-sitter $ tree-sitter init-config Then, we need to clone the tree-sitter-* GitHub repository we want to use. After cloning this repo, we can run the following commands (take tree-sitter-python for an example) sh $ git clone git@github.com:tree-sitter/tree-sitter-python.git $ tree-sitter generate # generate a parser in src/parser.c Tip If you want to use the tree-sitter CLI tool anywhere, then you need to Use the tree-sitter init-config command to find where the config file is in your OS Open this config file and check the parse-directories attribute Copy your tree-sitter-* GitHub repository to one of the folder Now, in the root directory of tree-sitter-python, we can generate the AST. Before that, let’s just write a simple Python code snippet. python def sum(x: int, y: int) -\u003e int: return x + y sum(1, 2) Then, we can use the following command to parse this code snippet. The output should be like lisp (module [0, 0] - [5, 0] (function_definition [0, 0] - [1, 16] name: (identifier [0, 4] - [0, 7]) parameters: (parameters [0, 7] - [0, 23] (typed_parameter [0, 8] - [0, 14] (identifier [0, 8] - [0, 9]) type: (type [0, 11] - [0, 14] (identifier [0, 11] - [0, 14]))) (typed_parameter [0, 16] - [0, 22] (identifier [0, 16] - [0, 17]) type: (type [0, 19] - [0, 22] (identifier [0, 19] - [0, 22])))) return_type: (type [0, 27] - [0, 30] (identifier [0, 27] - [0, 30])) body: (block [1, 4] - [1, 16] (return_statement [1, 4] - [1, 16] (binary_operator [1, 11] - [1, 16] left: (identifier [1, 11] - [1, 12]) right: (identifier [1, 15] - [1, 16]))))) (expression_statement [4, 0] - [4, 9] (call [4, 0] - [4, 9] function: (identifier [4, 0] - [4, 3]) arguments: (argument_list [4, 3] - [4, 9] (integer [4, 4] - [4, 5]) (integer [4, 7] - [4, 8]))))) The [x1, y1] - [x2, y2] here denotes the range of the source code for a specific AST node.

How to find the AST nodes you want to match? Just use the Query feature. The Query is just a S-expression. For example, if we want to find the function definition in Python code, we can write lisp (function_definition) In addition to that, the Tree-sitter also enables us to capture the matched source code and save it in a variable. We just need to put @variable_name after the specific S-expression. lisp (function_definition) @func Tip If you are using the online Playground, you can see the matched source code is highlighted. Tip There are two types of AST nodes in Tree-sitter. The first one is named AST node, and the other one is anonymous AST node. The syntax of named AST nodes is field_name: S-expression. Usually, we want to restrict the matched AST nodes. For example, we want to match an AST node only when it has specific children. We can do this by just adding the field: prefix. The following Query will find Python functions that have type hints for return value. lisp (function_definition return_type: (type)) @has_return_type_func Similarly, we can only match an AST node when it does not have specific children. We just need to add ! before a field. The following Query will find Python functions which does not have type hints for the return value. lisp (function_definition !return_type) @no_return_type_func What about the anonymous AST nodes? We specific the expected string directly without using the (). Let’s say we want to find binary operations which do addition lisp (binary_operator operator: \"+\") @add_op Tip The anonymous AST nodes won’t be shown in the AST. Then how can we know how to write the Query? The answer is hidden in the grammar.js file. I referred to these lines when I wrote the above Query.

All of *, ?, +, [abc] are supported. Just consider the following Python code. python arr1 = [] arr2 = [1] arr3 = [1, 2] We want to extract all the integers within all Python lists. However, the number of integers varies in different lists. That is exactly what * did in regex expression lisp ((integer) (\",\" (integer))*)@int_list Besides, the Query supports the . mark. The functionality will change depending on the location of . If . appears before the first children (denoted by S2), then the S2 must be the first children of the parent node (denoted by S1). If we want to extract all the first elements in all Python lists, we can write lisp (list . (integer) @first_int) If . appears after the last children (denoted by Sn), then the Sn must be the last children of the parent node (denoted by S1). If we want to extract all the last elements in all Python lists, we can write lisp (list (integer) @last_int .) Things get more complicated when the elements within a Python list have different types. For example python arr1 = [] arr2 = [None] arr3 = [1, 2, \"90\"] Now we can not just use (integer) to match the elements. What we need is a special mark that denotes any possibility. That is what _ did in Python code, the Query just borrows it. lisp (list (_) @last_int .) Tip The (_) can match any named AST nodes, and the _ can match both named AST nodes and anonymous AST nodes.

Using @variable_name to capture the matched source code is indeed useful. If we can apply some condition to control if the match is considered legal, it would be much better! Luckily, the Tree-sitter offers this functionality called predicate :) The predicate is also a S-expression, and the syntax is (S1 S2 S3) S1: It can be any of #eq?, #not-eq?, #any-eq?, #any-not-eq?, #match?, #not-match?, #any-match?, #any-not-match?, #any-of?, #not-any-of?.

First, we need to install some packages sh $ pip install tree-sitter $ pip install tree-sitter-python Then we can start to write Python code. After generating the Parser, we can exploit the parser to parse Python code. python import tree_sitter_python as tspython from tree_sitter import Language, Parser PY_LANGUAGE = Language(tspython.language()) code = \"\"\"def sum(x: int, y: int) -\u003e int: return x + y sum(1, 2) \"\"\" parser = Parser(PY_LANGUAGE) tree = parser.parse(bytes(code, encoding=\"utf8\")) Now tree is the AST.

However, I find that once the tuple has many fields, I’m forced to add a comment to indicate the meaning of each field. For example, python t = (3, 4, 3.5) # (x, y, value) Then, I can jump to this definition and check the comment to see each field’s meaning. But indeed, this brings a lot of inconvenience, once the code becomes longer it’s not easy to locate that specific line of code. So I would write a class, which allows me to reference a field by name instead of by position. The naive way contains boilerplate template, including __init__, __repr__ , etc. The topic today is dataclass, which saves us from writing such a boilerplate template.

However, the dataclass is much more powerful than you might think. It enables us to control the generation behaviors in general, as well as the behavior of each field The @dataclass is a decorator, that is, a kind of special function. We can control the generation behaviors by modifying the parameters. The most important arguments in my opinion are as follows (I also show the default settings) python @dataclass( init=true, # generate __init__ method repr=true, # generate __repr__ method # default format: \u003cclassname\u003e(field1=..., field2=..., ...) eq=true, # compare dataclasses like tuples order=false, # generate __lt/lt/gt/ge__ methods frozen=false, # if true, assigning to fields will generate an exception ) Take order as an example, we wish the Point is comparable: first by comparing the coordinates (x, y) and then by comparing the value python from dataclasses import dataclass @dataclass(order=True) class Point: x: int y: int value: float foo = Point(3, 4, 3.5) # __init__ bar = Point(3, 4, 4.5) # __init__ print(foo \u003c bar) # __eq__ To control each field’s behavior, we need to use the field in the dataclass library. It also has many arguments, you may refer to the official documentation, I will only talk about some important arguments in my opinion default, default_factory, we use one of the arguments to set the default values. The former directly sets a default value, while the latter specifies a constructor without arguments (For example, list, set, etc.) repr, should we generate the string representation for this field? Let’s say now we change the value field to values, that is, we want each coordinate to hold a list of values python from dataclasses import dataclass, field @dataclass class Point: x: int y: int value: list[float] = field(default_factory=list) foo = Point(3, 4, [3.5, 4.5, 5.5]) # __init__ print(foo.__annotations__) Finally, let’s talk about the inheritance scenario. The data class decorated by @dataclass is also a data class, we can inherit another data class as we wish. What if both of them contain fields with the same name? For example python from dataclasses import dataclass @dataclass class A: x: int = 1 y: int = 2 z: int = 5 @dataclass class B(A): x: int = 3 y: int = 4 foo = B() print(foo) # B(x=3, y=4, z=5) It works like this1: Using MRO to decide the visit order, that is, starting from Object class and collecting fields Finally, add the data class’s fields and merge the result. If multiple fields have the same name, the latter will override the earlier ones.

Additionally, the fetch-depth: 0 setting ensures that all commits are cloned during the process. The next step is installing Hugo itself. Although the official Hugo document provides a detailed implementation, I found it somewhat cumbersome. So I did some research and found actions-hugo, which can download Hugo for us and is easy to use. I set hugo-version: 'latest' to ensure it always uses the latest Hugo. Since DoIt use features like admonition, we also need to set extended: true, which means using the extended version of Hugo.

So, we run hugo -t DoIt first Now we can run node push_algolia_json.js. If you are curious about how to write push_algolia_json.js, you can check atomic-algolia Finally, we come to the most complex part - deploying the Hugo Blog. The author of actions-hugo also offers another action called actions-gh-pages to simplify the deployment. However, the complexity arises from the repositories themselves. As mentioned earlier, I have 2 repositories. I first build the Hugo Blog in the private repository and then deploy it to the public repository. According to the README.md in actions-gh-pages, we need to set the external_repository attribute, which points to the public repository. Because this action involves two repositories, we also need to set deploy_key, which means we need to generate a paired ssh-key. The following diagram illustrates this idea. flowchart LR private(\"` Private repo (use the *private* ssh-key as a *secret*) `\") --\u003e|peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v4| public(\"` Public repo (use the *public* ssh-key as a *deploy key*) `\") First, let’s generate paired ssh-key by the following command sh # replace with your email here. $ ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C martinlwx@163.com -f \"hugo\" In the current directory, you will see there are hugo and hugo.pub files Open the public repository, click Settings -\u003e Deploy keys -\u003e Add deploey key, and copy and paste the content of hugo.pub.

To get the benefits of TCO, we need to learn how to rewrite any naive recursion function to a tail-recursion. One of the popular ways is the accumulator pattern. Steps to follow3 Create a helper function which usually has two parameters The data to be processed The accumulated value The base case of the helper function is: returning the accumulated value The base case of the original recursive function changes to calling the helper function Let’s use a classic recursive function which calculates the factorial as an example. First, create a new project with dune sh $ dune init project tco Then we can easily write a naive recursive function in ./tco/bin/main.ml` as follows ocaml let rec factorial n = match n with 0 | 1 -\u003e 1 | n -\u003e n * factorial (n - 1) It’s obvious that this function is not tail-recursive. The reason is that we still need to multiply the return value of factorial (n - 1) by n. Now we can rewrite this function to a tail-recursive function using the accumulator pattern. ocaml let factorial_tco n = let rec helper cur acc = match cur with | 0 | 1 -\u003e acc (* Return the accumulated value *) | cur -\u003e (helper [@tailcall]) (cur - 1) (acc * cur) in helper n 1 (* Call the helper function *) Tip We can use the [@tailcall] annotation to ensure a function call is a tail call, otherwise, the compiler will throw a warning. To benchmark the two implementations, we can use the core_bench tool. Let’s first install the required packages sh $ opam install core_bench After the installation, we need to change the configuration file ./tco/bin/dune lisp (executable (public_name tco) (name main) (libraries tco core core_bench core_unix.command_unix)) Now, we can add the performance testing code in ./tco/bin/main.ml as follows ocaml open Core open Core_bench let rec factorial n = match n with | 0 | 1 -\u003e 1 | n -\u003e n * factorial (n - 1) let factorial_tco n = let rec helper cur acc = match cur with | 0 | 1 -\u003e acc | cur -\u003e (helper [@tailcall]) (cur - 1) (acc * cur) in helper n 1 (* Benchmark *) let bench () = Bench.make_command [ Bench.Test.create ~name:\"factorial\" (fun () -\u003e factorial 10000); Bench.Test.create ~name:\"factorial_tco\" (fun () -\u003e factorial_tco 10000); ] |\u003e Command_unix.run let _ = bench () Build then run sh $ dune build $ dune exec tco The output of performance testing in my MacBook M3 Air is: text Estimated testing time 20s (2 benchmarks x 10s).

It reminds me of the code, which is highly structured text. Occasionally, we want to delete the entire function body and rewrite it. If the function body is enclosed in {}, then typically we can use ci{ to accomplish this task. However, care must be taken regarding the cursor’s position to ensure the {} of the function body is closet to the cursor, which can be somewhat annoying. Example The function body in Rust is enclosed in {}. To delete the entire function body and rewrite it, we can place the cursor on the i in if, and then type ci{ rust fn fib(n: i32) -\u003e i32 { // The position of your cursor(on `i`) // v if n == 1 || n == 2 { 1 } else { fib(n - 1) + fib(n-2) } } But what if the function body is not enclosed in {}? For example, the Python code uses indentation to recognize the function body. python def fib(n: int): if n == 1 or n == 2: return 1 return fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2) Is there a special text-object that corresponds to the function body considering that the code is highly structured?

We won’t need to compute these again and again. That’s what exactly the KV Cache does. After applying the KV Cache, in each round except the first one, we only need to focus on the last input token. We will compute its query, key, and value vectors and use these 3 new vectors to perform a self-attention operation with all the cached key/value vectors of preceding tokens. I drew a simple picture to show what happened we when used the KV Cache to speed up the inference process. Consider that the LLM generates 4 tokens starting from scratch, where the blue part represents the values that are cached, and the red part indicates what’s not cached ","date":"2023-10-12","objectID":"/en/llm-inference-optimization-kv-cache/:2:0","series":null,"tags":["NLP","Deep-Learning"],"title":"LLM inference optimization - KV Cache","uri":"/en/llm-inference-optimization-kv-cache/#demystify-the-kv-cache"},{"categories":["ML-DL"],"content":" The performance of the KV CacheThe principle behind accelerating inference with the KV Cache is as follows: in the self-attention layer, instead of performing the matrix multiplication $\\mathbf Q\\mathbf K^T$ in each iteration, we only need to perform vector-matrix multiplication between the query vector $\\mathbf q$ of the last token of each input and $\\mathbf K$, and then we update the KV Cache.

There are mainly two approaches: freeze the entire LLM and perform prompt tuning or In-context Learning; freeze the entire LLM but inserting trainable modules. Today, I will introduce the LoRA(Low-Rank Adaptation), which corresponds to the latter technical approach. This is a work proposed by the Microsoft team1 The idea behind LoRA is quite simple. If you are familiar with deep learning, you should know that the parameters are updated by the gradient descent. Let’s consider a weight matrix $\\mathbf W_0\\in\\mathcal{R}^{d\\times d}$(the subscript 0 here means it’s the initial value), we can use $\\Delta \\mathbf W$ to denote the relative change to the initial value when it has been trained. After training, the parameters of this matrix will be $$\\mathbf W_0+\\Delta \\mathbf W$$ The problem that LoRA aims to solve is whether it is possible to determine the $\\Delta \\mathbf W$ without altering $\\mathbf W_0$ and with minimal computation cost. This is achievable because researchers have found that the intrinsic rank of a learned LLM model is low. Therefore, the authors hypothesize that the weight change($\\Delta \\mathbf W$) during model adaption also has a low intrinsic rank, which allows us to perform a low-rank decomposition of $\\Delta\\mathbf W$. Experimental results have shown that this assumption holds, and LoRA fine-tuning achieves promising results1. The low-rank decomposition is as follows $$\\Delta \\mathbf W=\\mathbf B\\mathbf A$$ where $\\mathbf B\\in\\mathcal{R}^{d\\times r}$，$\\mathbf A\\in\\mathcal{R}^{r\\times d}$, the matrix $\\mathbf B$ is initialized with zero and the matrix $\\mathbf A$ is initialized with a random Gaussian. This ensures that at the beginning of training, the LoRA module has no impact on the original model. If the input is $\\mathbf x$, then the computation will be $$\\mathbf W_0\\mathbf x+\\frac{\\alpha}{r}\\Delta \\mathbf W\\mathbf x=\\mathbf W_0\\mathbf x+\\frac{\\alpha}{r}\\mathbf B\\mathbf A\\mathbf x$$ The $\\alpha$ here is a scaling factor, and $r$ is the value of low-rank During training, only $\\mathbf B$ and $\\mathbf A$ are updated by the gradient descent. During inference, we can combine $\\mathbf W_0$ with $\\mathbf B\\mathbf A$ just like the LoRA module does not exist. It is a significant advantage of LoRA: it does not introduce inference latency👍 Additionally, we can calculate the change in the number of learnable parameters when using LoRA. $$ (\\mathbf W_0+\\frac{\\alpha}{r}\\Delta\\mathbf W)\\mathbf x=\\mathbf W_0\\mathbf x+\\frac{\\alpha}{r}\\Delta \\mathbf W\\mathbf x=\\mathbf W_0\\mathbf x+\\frac{\\alpha}{r}\\mathbf B\\mathbf A\\mathbf x $$ The learnable parameters we need to train are significantly reduced because $r«d$, which makes LoRA a parameter-efficient fine-tuning method. 👍 Two questions remaining - where should LoRA be applied in the transformer architecture? what is the optimal value for r? In section 7.1 of the paper, the authors found that applying LoRA to both the $\\mathbf W_q$ and $\\mathbf W_v$ yields the best result1 In section 7.2 of the paper, the authors discovered that increasing r does not always lead to significant improvements. and the values around 4 ~ 8 work well, which suggest that a low-rank adaptation matrix is sufficient1 ","date":"2023-09-14","objectID":"/en/lora-finetuning/:1:0","series":null,"tags":["Paper","Internal","Deep-Learning"],"title":"LoRA fine-tuning","uri":"/en/lora-finetuning/#whats-lora"},{"categories":["ML-DL"],"content":" How to use LoRAThe Huggingface has a library called peft which supports LoRA fine-tuning and many other fine-tuning techniques.

If you are familiar with the backtracing algorithm, you might try to enumerate all possible permutations and try to find the specific one. However, the time complexity is awful which is $O(N!)$. That brings us to the following question Q1 - What are the characteristics of generating the next lexicographical permutation problem during backtracking? Let’s use a simple example [1, 2, 3, 4] and enumerate its permutations in lexicographical order. Python [[1, 2, 3, 4], [1, 2, 4, 3], [1, 3, 2, 4], [1, 3, 4, 2], [1, 4, 2, 3], [1, 4, 3, 2], [2, 1, 3, 4], ... # omit [4, 3, 2, 1]] What makes [2, 1, 3, 4] the next lexicographical permutation of [1, 4, 3, 2]? Could you spot any patterns? More specifically, why did the value of the first position change from 1 to 2? What’s the characteristics of [1, 4, 3, 2]? The answer is: 4, 3, 2 is the longest non-increasing suffix(LNIS). Does this rule apply to any situation? Let’s see another example, [1, 2, 4, 3] -\u003e [1, 3, 2, 4]. We can see that the LNIS of [1, 2, 4, 3] is [4, 3], and the second position changes from 2 to 3. Let’s line these up to make it more clear Python [1, 4, 3, 2] ^ # LNIS [2, 1, 3, 4] ^ # change this [1, 2, 4, 3] ^ # LNIS [1, 3, 2, 4] ^ # change this So we can conclude - Find the start position j of LNIS in the sequence and try to increase the value in position j - 1. This explains the step 1 of the aforementioned algorithm. If you are not convinced by the above observation, then you can try to understand this from the backtracing perspective. When will we increase the value of position j - 1? When we have already enumerated all the permutations of a[j:] and returns from the recursive function call. The a[j:] subsequence would be in non-increasing order since we try to set the value of each position in lexicographical order. Python indices: 0, 1, 2, ..., j - 1, j, ..., n - 1 # a[j - 1] \u003c a[j] A1 - To generate the next lexicographical permutation, we will always try to increase the previous position of LNIS For the convenience of subsequent discussion, we call the position on the left of the LNIS found earlier as pivot (that is, j - 1 in front). So now comes the second question Q2 - How to change the value of a[pivot]? We are concerned about the next lexicographical permutation, so we want to make a[pivot] slightly bigger. But how can we find the next greater value of a[pivot]? The answer is: this element is located in a[pivot + 1:], that is, we need to find a position whose value is bigger than a[pivot], and this value should be as small as possible. Do not forget that a[pivot+1:] is the LNIS, which means that we can search `a[pivot + 1:] from right to left. This explains the step 2 of the aforementioned algorithm. A2 - Search a[pivot + 1:] from right to left whose value is bigger than a[pivot] and this value should be as small as possible. Let’s denote the index of this value as r Now there are only two remaining steps to explain, and they are related Q3 - Why should we swap a[pivot] and a[r], then reverse the a[pivot + 1:] suffix? Theoretically speaking, after we modify the value of a[pivot], the part of a[pivot + 1:] also needs to be modified, so the question is how to modify it. From the backtracing perspective, a[pivot + 1] should start from the smallest lexicographical order, that is, a[pivot + 1:] should be in non-decreasing order. Interestingly, the swap operation does not change the order of a[pivot + 1:], which means the a[pivot + 1:] is still in non-increasing order. To make it in non-decreasing order, we just need to reverse this part. This explains the step 3 \u0026 4 of this algorithm A3 - The swap operation does not change the order of a[pivot + 1:]. We reverse a[pivot + 1:] to make it in non-decreasing order ","date":"2023-09-06","objectID":"/en/the-next-lexicographical-permutation-problem/:3:0","series":null,"tags":["Algorithm"],"title":"The next lexicographical permutation problem","uri":"/en/the-next-lexicographical-permutation-problem/#algorithm-explained"},{"categories":["Algorithm"],"content":" CodeThe Leetcode offers a practice, you can examine your understanding there.

There are three methods available: Char-level Word-level Subword-level Let’s talk about the Char-level tokenizer. That is, we tokenize the text into a char stream. For instance, highest -\u003e h, i, g, h, e, s, t. One advantage of the Char-level tokenizer is that the size of Vocab won’t be that large. The size of Vocab is equal to the size of the alphabet. So you probably won’t meet the infamous Out-of-vocabulary(OOV) problem. However, the downside is that the char itself does not convey too much information, and we will get too many tokens after tokenizing. Try to imagine that a simple word highest will give us 7 tokens😨 The Word-level tokenizer is slightly better. In the Word-level tokenizer, we usually divide text into individual words using whitespace or punctuation marks. so the number of tokens after tokenizing won’t be too high. For instance, Today is a good day -\u003e Today, is, a, good, day. However, the Word-level tokenizer is not perfect. In English, the words high, higher, highest are semantically similar, with the latter two being comparative forms, but Word-level tokenization would treat them as three separate words. 🤔️ Is there a better way such that we most likely avoid the OOV problem, have a reasonable number of tokens after tokenizing, and also consider compound words, tense variations, etc.? This is where subword level tokenization comes into play. Using the same example as before, a subword tokenizer will most likely tokenize it as high, er, high, est. Therefore, the subword level tokenization involves representing a word using multiple subwords. The method I’m introducing today, BPE (Byte-Pair Encoding), belongs to the subword level category. There is one subtle thing to think about - What does the byte in the byte pair mean? We know that every char is 1 byte if we are using the ASCII encoding. However, what if we are using utf-8 encoding? A char may be 1 ~ 4 bytes. 🤔️ So, if BPE is applied to utf-8 text, what does a byte pair refer to? Thus, I feel there’s a bit of ambiguity here. Therefore, a better way to understand it might be that a byte pair is essentially a char pair, where char here refers to a utf-8 character.

Let’s assume that we have some documents $D={d_1,d_2,…}$ For each $d$, we will transform the documents into word list in some way. For instance, you may choose to split the document by whitespace to get words Count the word freq for each word $w$ in $D$, and we can also get the alphabet of $D$ as the initial vocab(plus the \u003c/w\u003e). The alphabet contains all the unique utf-8 char in all documents $D$ For each word, transform the word into a utf-8 char list. We call it a split. For example, highest -\u003e h, i, g, h, e, s, t Append \u003c/w\u003e to each utf-8 list. e.g. highest -\u003e h, i, g, h, e, s, t, \u003c/w\u003e Repeat the following steps until any one of the two conditions is met: 1) Vocab reaches the upper limit. 2) Reach the maximum number of iterations Find the most frequent pair, add it to a merge table, and add the merged result to the vocab Update all splits of all words. For example, the most frequent pair may be (h, i) in our previous example, then we will add hi to the Vocab and change the split highest -\u003e hi, g, h, e, s, t, \u003c/w\u003e You may have 3 puzzles: Why word frequency? Because we want to find the most frequent pair easily Why append \u003c/w\u003e? Because we want to reconstruct the input later, we use \u003c/w\u003e to mark that it is the end of a word What if we have multiple pairs with the same frequency?

Note that we can also choose (e, r) because they have the same frequency python { \"highest\": [\"h\", \"i\", \"g\", \"h\", \"es\", \"t\", \"\u003c/w\u003e\"], \"higher\": [\"h\", \"i\", \"g\", \"h\", \"e\", \"r\", \"\u003c/w\u003e\"], \"lower\": [\"l\", \"o\", \"w\", \"e\", \"r\", \"\u003c/w\u003e\"], \"lowest\": [\"l\", \"o\", \"w\", \"es\", \"t\", \"\u003c/w\u003e\"], \"cooler\": [\"c\", \"o\", \"o\", \"l\", \"e\", \"r\", \"\u003c/w\u003e\"], \"collest\": [\"c\", \"o\", \"o\", \"l\", \"es\", \"t\", \"\u003c/w\u003e\"], } This time, the most frequently occurring pair is (es, t). We follow the same procedure and update the splits python { \"highest\": [\"h\", \"i\", \"g\", \"h\", \"est\", \"\u003c/w\u003e\"], \"higher\": [\"h\", \"i\", \"g\", \"h\", \"e\", \"r\", \"\u003c/w\u003e\"], \"lower\": [\"l\", \"o\", \"w\", \"e\", \"r\", \"\u003c/w\u003e\"], \"lowest\": [\"l\", \"o\", \"w\", \"est\", \"\u003c/w\u003e\"], \"cooler\": [\"c\", \"o\", \"o\", \"l\", \"e\", \"r\", \"\u003c/w\u003e\"], \"collest\": [\"c\", \"o\", \"o\", \"l\", \"est\", \"\u003c/w\u003e\"], } The most frequently occurring is (est, \u003c/w\u003e) python { \"highest\": [\"h\", \"i\", \"g\", \"h\", \"est\u003c/w\u003e\"], \"higher\": [\"h\", \"i\", \"g\", \"h\", \"e\", \"r\", \"\u003c/w\u003e\"], \"lower\": [\"l\", \"o\", \"w\", \"e\", \"r\", \"\u003c/w\u003e\"], \"lowest\": [\"l\", \"o\", \"w\", \"est\u003c/w\u003e\"], \"cooler\": [\"c\", \"o\", \"o\", \"l\", \"e\", \"r\", \"\u003c/w\u003e\"], \"collest\": [\"c\", \"o\", \"o\", \"l\", \"est\u003c/w\u003e\"], } The most frequently occurring is (e, r) python { \"highest\": [\"h\", \"i\", \"g\", \"h\", \"est\u003c/w\u003e\"], \"higher\": [\"h\", \"i\", \"g\", \"h\", \"er\", \"\u003c/w\u003e\"], \"lower\": [\"l\", \"o\", \"w\", \"er\", \"\u003c/w\u003e\"], \"lowest\": [\"l\", \"o\", \"w\", \"est\u003c/w\u003e\"], \"cooler\": [\"c\", \"o\", \"o\", \"l\", \"er\", \"\u003c/w\u003e\"], \"collest\": [\"c\", \"o\", \"o\", \"l\", \"est\u003c/w\u003e\"], } The most frequently occurring is (er, \u003c/w\u003e) python { \"highest\": [\"h\", \"i\", \"g\", \"h\", \"est\u003c/w\u003e\"], \"higher\": [\"h\", \"i\", \"g\", \"h\", \"er\u003c/w\u003e\"], \"lower\": [\"l\", \"o\", \"w\", \"er\u003c/w\u003e\"], \"lowest\": [\"l\", \"o\", \"w\", \"est\u003c/w\u003e\"], \"cooler\": [\"c\", \"o\", \"o\", \"l\", \"er\u003c/w\u003e\"], \"collest\": [\"c\", \"o\", \"o\", \"l\", \"est\u003c/w\u003e\"], } I believe the example above is quite clear enough.

Today we take a step further to see if we can try to fix one of the limitations - Each word has the same importance. 💡 The crux of the problem - How to define the word importance? One idea is: The more frequently a word appears within a single document, the more important it is for that document. For instance, in an article discussing dogs, the word “dog” is likely to appear frequently, reflecting the document’s main topic. But what if a word appears very frequently in all documents? For example, the word “of” may appear quite often in every document, can we say “of” is important? Clearly, that’s not the case. So we have a clue here: If a word has a high frequency in every document, probably it’s not significant and does not convey too much information. Therefore, a reasonable solution should consider a word’s frequency within a single document but also take into account its frequency crossing multiple documents. TF-IDF balances these two aspects. In summary, the intuition behind TF-IDF is - Similar documents may use similar words, while the importance of different words should vary.

It doesn’t involve dividing by the total number of words in the document. The purpose of dividing is to normalize the $\\text{TF}(w, d)$ values within the document $d$, making them add up to one.

Different frameworks might have variations. Scikit-Learn use $ln$ 🐛 In Scikit-Learn, the calculation of IDF differs from the equations mentioned above.

The TF-IDF value for document is 1.22314, while the TF-IDF value for first is 1.51082, due to the unequal presence of these words in the corpus.

The length of the BoW vector will be equal to the size of the vocab For each document in the corpus, identify words that are not currently present in the existing vocabulary, and subsequently incorporate these words into the vocabulary list. After constructing a BoW model, we can use it to transform any document into a vector representation. The procedure is simple, we just count the occurrences of each word in the document. Note that we only consider vocab words and ignore the out-of-vocabulary(OOV) words. Let’s use a toy example to illustrate this idea1 python toy_corpus = [ 'This is the first document.', 'This is the second second document.', 'And the third one.', 'Is this the first document?', ] Remove punctuation, then tokenize with spaces, and also convert all the words to lowercase. After preprocessing, we can obtain: python tokenized_toy_corpus = [ ['this', 'is', 'the', 'first', 'document'], ['this', 'is', 'the', 'second', 'second', 'document'], ['and', 'the', 'third', 'one'], ['is', 'this', 'the', 'first', 'document'] ] To simplify matters, let’s encompass all words within the corpus and incorporate them into our vocabulary. python flatten_list_as_set = set(sum(tokenized_toy_corpus, start=[])) print(f\"the toy vocab size: {len(flatten_list_as_set)}\") the toy vocab size: 9 💡 A nice trick to flatten this list :D Now, let’s assign a unique token id to each word in the vocab python toy_token2id = {} for token in sorted(flatten_list_as_set): toy_token2id[token] = len(toy_token2id) print(toy_token2id) { 'and': 0, 'document': 1, 'first': 2, 'is': 3, 'one': 4, 'second': 5, 'the': 6, 'third': 7, 'this': 8 } The vocab size is 9, then we know we can represent each document as a vector with a length 9 by counting the words Let’s manually implement this to see if we understand the ideas python BoW_matrix = [] for document in tokenized_toy_corpus: temp = [0] * 9 for token in document: temp[toy_token2id[token]] += 1 BoW_matrix.append(temp) print(BoW_matrix) [ [0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1], [0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 2, 1, 0, 1], [1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0], [0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1] ] The numbers may not be so intuitive, let’s add more information to make this better.

Each row is a BoW vector of the corresponding document. Take the 2nd row as an example, it means the document2 has: document * 1 is * 1 second * 2 the * 1 this * 1 Recall that the tokenized document2 is ['this', 'is', 'the', 'second', 'second', 'document'], which is aligned with the vector representation Now you know how to interpret the BoW matrix. :D 🧐 You might have observed that there are so many 0 in this matrix. Indeed, the BoW matrix tends to be sparse. That’s one of the limitations of BoW python from sklearn.metrics.pairwise import cosine_similarity We can use the inner product to measure the similarity between two vectors.

Now, I will use the technique mentioned earlier to derive it For simplicity, let’s ignore the bias term and only consider the weight term Consider a simple $L$ layers MLP, where $\\mathbf Z^l$ represents the output of layer $l$. We also use $\\mathbf Z$ to represent the input. Thus, we have: $$\\mathbf Z^0=\\mathbf X$$ Here, $\\mathbf X\\in\\mathcal{R}^{m\\times d}$, where $m$ is the number of samples, and $d$ is the length of each features for each sample The output of the model $f_\\theta$ is $$f_\\theta(\\mathbf X)=\\mathbf Z^{L}$$ Here, $\\theta$ represents the learnable parameters of this model The relationship between any continuous layers is: $$\\mathbf Z^{l+1}=\\sigma_{l+1}(\\mathbf Z^l\\mathbf W^{l+1}),l=0,…,L-1$$ Here, $\\sigma_{l+1}$ is the activate function of layer $l+1$ The shapes: $$\\mathbf Z^l\\in\\mathcal{R}^{m\\times n_l}$$ $$\\mathbf W^{l+1} \\in \\mathcal R^{n_l\\times n_{l+1}}$$ Here, $n_l$ represents the number of neurons in layer $l$ We want to determine the gradient of the loss $J$ with respect to any learnable parameter in the model.

At the low level, tensors can be stored either by rows or columns. Both Numpy and PyTorch adopt the approach of storing tensors by rows. Regardless of the tensor’s dimension, the underlying storage always occupies continuous memory space. Now, the question arises: How do we access the data at the desired positions? The answer is strides format. We may regard the strides format as a generalization version of the two previous indexing formats. Let’s consider a tensor of $N$ dimensions(0-based), and its underlying storage is represented as A_internal. If we want to access A[i0][i1][i2]..., the indexing is done as follows: python A[i0][i1][i2]... = A_internal[ stride_offset + i0 * A.strides[0] + i1 * A.strides[1] + i2 * A.strides[2] + ... + in-1 * A.strides[n-1] ] The strides format has two components: offset - the offset of the tensor relative to the underlying storage strides array, whose length is equal to the number of dimensions of the tensor. strides[i] indicates how many “elements” need to be skipped in memory to move “one unit” in the $i$-th dimension of the tensor For example, considering the earlier example of a 2D array, if we interpret it using the strides format python A[i][j] = A_in_row[ 0 + i * A.shape[1] + j * 1 ] For a 2D array of size (A.shape[0], A.shape[1]), its offset is 0, and the strides array is [A.shape[1], 1](row-major). 🤔️ This means that moving “one unit” in the first dimension requires skipping A.shape[1] elements in the underlying memory, where A.shape[1] is the length of each row I made this image to give you better intuition :) 🧐 How to obtain the strides array for an $N$ dimensional tensor? Let’s say we want to calculate strides[k] for the $k$-th dimension. We know the semantic of strides[k] is the elements to skip in the underlying memory to moving “one unit” in the $k$-th dimension, If the memory layout of the tensor is continuous, then the answer would be the product of $k+1,k+2,…, N-1$. If $k=N-1$, then strides[N - 1] = 1 The mathematical formula is as follows: $$strides[k]=\\prod_{i=k+1}^{N-1}shape[i]$$ 💡 It is important to reiterate that the above formula holds only when the tensor’s underlying memory layout is contiguous.

Pytorch provides us with the data_ptr API, which will return the address of the first element of a tensor. Then, by using the storage().nbytes() method provided by PyTorch, we can determine the amount of memory space the tensor’s underlying storage occupies(in bytes)1. Additionally, the dtype attribute of the tensor informs us about the size of each element. For example, torch.float32 occupies 4 bytes Finally, we can use the ctypes.string_at(address, size=-1) function to read the tensor as a C-style string (buffer), and torch.frombuffer can be used to create a tensor from this buffer. Putting it all together, we can write this helper function called print_internal: python def print_internal(t: torch.Tensor): print( torch.frombuffer( ctypes.string_at(t.data_ptr(), t.storage().nbytes()), dtype=t.dtype ) ) Now we create a tensor t with dimension (1, 2, 3, 4) and observe its underlying representation.

Moreover, the indexing operation may access the non-contiguous parts of the underlying storage. So the indexing operation will help us to understand the reshape and contiguous operations better. Let’s say we want to get the following tensor from t python [[[2, 6, 10], [14, 18, 22]]] The corresponding indexing operation is python print(t[:, :, :, 2]) # tensor([[[ 2, 6, 10], # [14, 18, 22]]]) Note that this operation aligns with what I mentioned earlier: the offset will change because the resulting tensor starts from 2 rather than 0 The elements accessed by indexing are not contiguous in the original memory The following code proves our speculation python print(t.storage_offset()) # 0 print(t[:, :, :, 2].storage_offset()) # 2 print(t[:, :, :, 2].is_contiguous()) # False Now let’s observe the underlying storage python print_internal(t[:, :, :, 2]) # tensor([ 2, 3, # 4, 5, 6, 7, # 8, 9, 10, 11, # 12, 13, 14, 15, # 16, 17, 18, 19, # 20, 21, 22, 23 # 1152921504606846976, -8070441752123218147]]) # ignore the last row because t.data_ptr() has changed but t.storage().nbytes() # kept the same. # As a result, we read 2 invalid elements and get 2 meaningless values Pytorch’s tensor has a method called storage_offset() which shows the offset in the underlying storage. As we can see, now it starts from the second position in the underlying storage, which corresponds to the first element 2 of t[:, :, :, 2]. And the underlying storage is still the same Note: Because the underlying storage remains unchanged, t.storage().nbytes() remains the same. The data_ptr() will give us the address of the second element. As a result, the printed underlying array will have two additional meaningless positions (as seen in the last row), resulting in two extra irrelevant numbers. 🤔️ Let’s try to use reshape(3, 2) after indexing and observe the underlying storage python print_internal(t[:, :, :, 2].reshape(3, 2)) # tensor([ 2, 3, # 4, 5, 6, 7, # 8, 9, 10, 11, # 12, 13, 14, 15, # 16, 17, 18, 19, # 20, 21, 22, 23 # 1152921504606846976, -8070441752123218147]]) We find that the reshape operation does not change the underlying storage. This aligns with what the documentation states: When possible, the returned tensor will be a view of input4 What if we want the tensor after reshape to have compact storage? We can use the contiguous method python print_internal(t[:, :, :, 2].reshape(3, 2).contiguous()) # tensor([ 2, 6, 10, 14, 18, 22]) 😺 By chaining reshape and contiguous operations, we make the underlying storage compact. And the strides array should align with the aforementioned formula: python # before contiguous print(t[:, :, :, 2].reshape(3, 2).stride()) # (8, 4) # after contiguous print(t[:, :, :, 2].reshape(3, 2).contiguous().shape) # (3, 2) print(t[:, :, :, 2].reshape(3, 2).contiguous().stride()) # (2, 1) 🧐 One challenging question for you, how indexing operation will change the strides array? Let’s use the previous indexing operation as an example. First, after indexing, the new dimensions should be (1, 2, 3). The indexing pattern [:, :, :, 2] results in a non-compact underlying storage. So we can not just compute the strides array by the rule. Therefore, we have to reason the strides array based on the definitions. Let’s assume the strides array of t[:, :, :, 2] is [x, y, z] We can observe which elements are included in t[:, :, :, 2] python print(t[:, :, :, 2]) # tensor([[[ 2, 6, 10], # [14, 18, 22]]]) Because the tensor t starts from 0 and increments by one, we can just compute the strides based on the values(a little trick) for z, we find 2 -\u003e 6 -\u003e 10, that is, we skip 4 elements each time. So z = 4 for y, we find 2 -\u003e 14, 6 -\u003e 18, 10 -\u003e 22, we skip 12 elements each time. So y = 12 for x, since the underlying storage has not changed, the original tensor","date":"2023-07-14","objectID":"/en/how-to-reprensent-a-tensor-or-ndarray/:4:4","series":null,"tags":["Internal","Pytorch","Deep-Learning"],"title":"Demystifying Pytorch's Strides Format","uri":"/en/how-to-reprensent-a-tensor-or-ndarray/#reshape-operation-and-contiguous-operation"},{"categories":["ML-DL","Internal"],"content":" Wrap upAs you can see, many operations on Pytorch tensors are achieved by modifying the offset or(and) strides array. This approach allows many operations to maintain zero-copy overhead, leading to high efficiency. Moreover, this enables the lazy operations. Understanding the strides format helps in constructing a mental model of tensors and facilitates a better understanding of tensor operation code. I would also recommend watching the awesome video which talks about the cool tricks that manipulating strides to perform convolution efficiently Now we can answer the questions raised earlier: Does broadcasting involve copying arrays? No, broadcasting will only change the strides array What does contiguous do in Pytorch, and why is this function needed? By using contiguous, we can make the underlying storage compact. Although this may involve copying, it is beneficial for later calculation because of the memory locality.

It entails keeping track of complex tree rotations and the necessity to recolor nodes as required. I once read the renowned Introducing to Algorithms written by the CLRS. However, there are so many cases to remember and I quickly get overwhelmed. Of course, the best way to remember something is always to understand it. Recently, when I saw the slides for Stanford’s CS166 Advanced Data Structures course. It seems like I finally understand the Red-black tree - the Red-black tree is an isometry of 2-3-4 tree. They represent the structure of 2-3-4 trees in a different way1. So how can this help us? Well, We can deduce the changes in shape and color in a Red-black tree by observing the changes in the corresponding 2-3-4 tree. Before we begin, I assume that you are familiar with the following: You know the definitions of a 2-3-4 tree or B-tree. A 2-3-4 tree is a type of B-tree. You need to know how to perform deletion and insertion operations on a 2-3-4 tree, when nodes overflow or underflow, and how to handle these cases You know how to insert and delete nodes in a binary search tree(BST) because a Red-black tree itself is a BST that ensures a height of $O(log n)$. You should already know how to find the insertion position and determine which node to delete in BST You need to understand the definitions of Red-black trees and 2-3-4 trees. You should understand the properties of Red-black trees and which properties can be violated during node insertion and deletion Most importantly, you don’t need to memorize the rotations and color changes in Red-black trees because once you grasp the techniques I’m going to discuss today, you can establish an intuitive connection between operations on Red-black trees and operations on 2-3-4 trees ","date":"2023-07-01","objectID":"/en/how-to-memorize-insertion-and-deletion-in-rb-tree/:1:0","series":null,"tags":["Data-Structure"],"title":"How to memorize the Red-black tree","uri":"/en/how-to-memorize-insertion-and-deletion-in-rb-tree/#intro"},{"categories":["Data-Structure"],"content":" Nodes mappingsThere are 3 possible node types in a 2-3-4 tree: 2-node, 2 children with 1 key 3-node, 3 children with 2 key 4-node, 4 children with 3 key The node mappings tell us how to map a node in a 2-3-4 tree to nodes in the corresponding Red-black tree and vice versa.

In other cases, it is colored red. This is because one of the properties of Red-black trees states that every path from any node to its leaf nodes contains an equal number of black nodes. By coloring the newly inserted node in red, we can maintain this property. We will only consider the case where the newly inserted node is colored red later If the newly inserted node is red, it means that it may violate another property of the Red-black tree: there cannot be two consecutive red nodes. Red-black trees solve this problem by using tree rotations and node recoloring 🎨, but the rules can be complex and difficult to remember Before showing specific examples, let’s summarize the general approach to insertion: Insert this new node and color it red Transform the “violating part” of the Red-black tree into an equivalent form on a 2-3-4 tree Consider how to handle the equivalent form on the 2-3-4 tree After handling it on the 2-3-4 tree, transform it back to a Red-black tree. At this point, the shape and color are determined 💡 To help readers understand how to transform between 2-3-4 tree and Red-black tree, I have used a colored transparent box to highlight the equivalent parts before and after the transformation 💡 I chose to use specific numerical values instead of abstract symbols because it provides a more intuitive understanding and makes it easier for readers to find connections between 2-3-4 tree and Red-black tree ","date":"2023-07-01","objectID":"/en/how-to-memorize-insertion-and-deletion-in-rb-tree/:3:0","series":null,"tags":["Data-Structure"],"title":"How to memorize the Red-black tree","uri":"/en/how-to-memorize-insertion-and-deletion-in-rb-tree/#insertion"},{"categories":["Data-Structure"],"content":" Its parent node is blackA trivial case woudl be, the newly insertion node’s parent node is black.

Red-black trees do not allow such a situation to occur. In this case, the newly inserted node may or may not have an uncle node. Let’s first consider the scenario where it does not have an uncle node. We can easily draw the following possible forms: Please note that all of these forms are equivalent. Below, I will demonstrate how to operate the first example shown in the above diagram 💡 In the subsequent discussions of other scenarios, they may also have equivalent forms. However, the methods are generally similar, so I will pick one example to explain each time. Based on the node mappings mentioned earlier, the Red-black tree before insertion corresponds exactly to a 3-node on the 2-3-4 tree. Then, we insert the node 1 into the Red-black tree. At the same time, we perform the insertion operation on the 3-node, resulting in a 4-node. The 4-node satisfies the requirements of a 2-3-4 tree, so there is no need to split the node. At this point, we can transform it back into a Red-black tree based on the node mappings At this point, you may feel that the 2-3-4 tree doesn’t bring much convenience because a simple right rotation and recoloring are not complex tasks in this case. However, as the scenarios become more complex, you will find that the perspective from the 2-3-4 tree can be much easier to comprehend🤔️.

When we insert 1 into the Red-black tree, we also insert 1 into the 3-node consisting of 2 and 5. The resulting 1, 2, 5 is mapped to a black node with two red children according to the rules. The 7 node is mapped as a black node But what if the uncle node is red? For example, in the case shown below. This case will be slightly more complex. Because after inserting 1 into the equivalent 2-3-4 tree, we need to perform a split operation on 1, 2, 5, 7. This means that we need to insert the node 5 into the parent node. *Since we don’t know the specific state of the parent node, the ellipses(...) are used to represent the nodes on both sides of 5. Inserting a node into the parent node in the 2-3-4 tree may also cause the parent node to overflow, and in the worst case, we need to modify all the way back Additionally, it’s important to note that the grandparent node of the newly inserted node should be red. In the example, node 5 is the grandparent of the newly inserted node 1. This ensures that every path from any node to its leaf nodes contains the same number of black nodes. However, there is one exception, which is when the grandparent node is the root node of the Red-black tree. In that case, it should be black.

That’s also the reason why it’s called a “double black” node—we need to remind ourselves that two black nodes are needed here. 💡 Note that the color of node 6 is the same as the original color of node 5 If the sibling node is black and it has two black children In the above example, when we transform it into an equivalent 2-3-4 tree deletion operation, we encounter a situation in the 2-3-4 tree where a fusion operation is required because the sibling node 7 is a 2-node and cannot lend a key. The fusion operation involves borrowing a key from the parent node and merging it with the sibling node to form a 3-node - 5, 7 💡 However, note that in this fusion operation, when we borrow a key from the parent node, it may cause the parent node to underflow, just as we may encounter overflow when inserting a new node. Based on the node mappings rules, node 5 in this example should be colored black, and we can get rid of the “double black” node. However, we should not forget that 5 itself has its own color If 5 was originally red, then changing it to black is not a problem because node 7 is now red If 5 was originally black, then changing it to black would be problematic as it would result in a missing black node. In this case, node 5 becomes a new “double black” node, and we may need to continue adjusting upwards. This corresponds precisely to the underflow situation in a 2-3-4 tree. We need to bottom-up adjust our way back to the root node. Finally, if we find that the root node is a double black node, we simply change it to a black node. If the sibling node is red and it has two black childrenThe last scenario is when the sibling node is red and has two black children 💡 Note that if the sibling node is red, then the parent should be a black node, as a Red-black tree does not allow two consecutive red nodes This situation can be cleverly transformed into one of the previous cases Now the node 4’s sibling node is black ","date":"2023-07-01","objectID":"/en/how-to-memorize-insertion-and-deletion-in-rb-tree/:4:2","series":null,"tags":["Data-Structure"],"title":"How to memorize the Red-black tree","uri":"/en/how-to-memorize-insertion-and-deletion-in-rb-tree/#if-the-sibling-node-is-red-and-it-has-two-black-children"},{"categories":["Data-Structure"],"content":" Wrap upAfter examining the previous examples, we have discovered that we can think about how to handle operations on a 2-3-4 tree and then convert it back to a Red-black tree.

We can put ((iterative-improve good-enough? improve) (improve guess)) in the ... and it will work correctly. However, this may not be very intuitive. That’s where helper functions come in handy.

They are the type of problems that I can’t figure out on my own after thinking for a long time, but after seeing the answer, it suddenly becomes clear and reasonable. However, the next time I encounter a similar problem, I may forget how to solve it. I have also read many people’s solutions and tried to digest and apply their ideas, but I have been unable to find a particularly good framework that works for all dynamic programming problems. It seems that everyone has their way of solving dynamic programming problems, and when I try to apply their methods to new problems, I always encounter difficulties. Things start to change after I learned MIT6.006. The teacher presented 6 steps to solve dynamic programming problems, which is called the SRTBOT framework. I found it to be so useful and practical that I decided to write this blog post to share it with everyone 🙌 👉 Overall, this blog post is more suitable for those who already have a basic understanding of dynamic programming but have not yet found a systematic approach ","date":"2023-04-09","objectID":"/en/solving-dynamic-programming-problems-using-srtbot/:1:0","series":null,"tags":["Algorithm"],"title":"Solving DP problems by SRTBOT Framework","uri":"/en/solving-dynamic-programming-problems-using-srtbot/#intro"},{"categories":["Algorithm"],"content":" What’s the DP problem?The two main features of dynamic programming problems are “overlapping subproblems” and “optimal substructure” 1: Overlapping subproblems: Solving a dynamic programming problem often involves breaking it down into several overlapping subproblems. Optimal substructure: The solution to a large problem can be calculated by combining the optimal solutions of smaller subproblems. It is important to note the terms “overlapping” and “subproblems” in the above definitions. Emphasis is placed on overlapping because the power of dynamic programming lies in its ability to remember the answers(by memorization) to solve subproblems. Therefore, the more overlapping subproblems there are, the more pronounced the advantage of dynamic programming. 🤔️ If the subproblems are not overlapping, then we may use another algorithm - Divide and conquer. From the perspective of programming problems, the following two types of problems usually require dynamic programming algorithms: Optimization problems: finding the optimal solution + overlapping subproblems Combination problems: finding the number of possible solutions 📒 Alternatively, based on my personal experience, dynamic programming problems are generally recursive problems that can be solved by brute force, but they have a large number of overlapping subproblems, so they can be optimized using dynamic programming.

The subproblems defined here will include parameters. Specific techniques for defining subproblems will be mentioned later The parameters of subproblems generally include subsets of inputs. Different DP problems may have different input formats: binary trees, single sequences, numbers, etc Some tricks for defining subproblems: If the input is a single sequence A Prefix form: Define dp[i] as the solution to the subproblem with input A[:i+1], note that the interval representation here is based on Python and is left-closed and right-open Suffix form: Define dp[i] as the solution to the subproblem with input A[i:] Contiguous substrings of a sequence：Define dp[i][j] as the solution to the subproblem with input A[i:j+1] If the input is double sequences A 和 B There are a total of $3 \\times 3 = 9$ possible Cartesian products for the previous 3 types, depending on the specific situation *For example, in the problem of finding the longest common subsequence(LCS), dp[i][j] can be used to represent the LCS of inputs A[:i+1] and B[:j+1] If the input is number k Define dp[k] as the solution to the subproblem with input K. If the input is a binary tree r Define dp[r] as the solution to the subproblem with input being the subtree with r as the root node. In tree DP, pay attention to the relevance between “subproblem” and “subtree” 📒 Advanced: Once you have mastered the general approach above, you can solve many dynamic programming problems. However, you may find it difficult to relate subproblems with your loose definition. When you have difficulties in associating subproblems, you can always try to add constraints to the subproblems you define or expand the subproblems. In MIT 6.006, this is called Subproblem Constraints and Expansion Expanding subproblems is more common. Generally, this involves changing the form of dp[i] to dp[i][j], which will also change the definition of your subproblems. *For example, in 198. House Robber, an additional state can be introduced to remember whether house i was robbed or not I will also mention briefly what it means to add constraints to the definition of subproblems. *For example, if we define dp[i] as the solution with input A[:i+1], assuming that each A[i] has two states of being selected or not, we can consider defining dp[i] as the solution with input A[:i+1] and A[i] must be in the selected state (this may be a bit abstract. I will provide a link to a problem that can be handled in this way later). 📒 You will find that when defining subproblems, we don’t think about how to calculate the value. Don’t start thinking about how to calculate the value when defining subproblems.

It’s the way how we relate different subproblem(s). **The way to relate subproblem(s) is by making “decisions”. Here comes the question, what decisions we get? Read the problem description and you will find the answer. Then try to “locally brute-force” all possible answers to the question :) 👻 It’s fine that you find difficulties in finding the relationship at first. However, after getting enough practice, you will become comfortable. 🤔️ I found that when trying to recursively relate subproblem(s), it is always helpful to draw a dependency graph (nodes are subproblem and edges are “decisions”). The dependency graph not only clearly shows the relationship between subproblem(s) but also verify that there are overlapping subproblems python dp[i] (apply f to aggregate results) / | \\ (?)/ |(?) \\(?) / | \\ dp[j_1] dp[j_2] ... / \\ / \\ / \\ ... ... ... ... ... For example, in the problem of 70. Climbing stairs on LeetCode, where each time one can climb one or two steps ($K=2$), reaching the i-th step must have come from either the i-1-th step or the i-2-th step. Since we are looking for all possible ways to climb the stairs, dp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-2] python dp[i] (sum) / \\ (climb one step)/ \\(climb two steps) / \\ dp[i - 1] dp[i - 2] / \\ / \\ ... ...... ... 🤔️ You can use this example to understand the meaning of “local” in “local brute-force”: we only use one decision one-time. For example, you may want to climb one step at a time and finally climb n steps and try to find a relationship betweena dp[i] and dp[i - n]. That’s not local!

This is because when we use the bottom-up approach to solve dynamic programming problems, it can be seen as filling in a table. However, in my opinion, it is more helpful to understand dynamic programming by viewing it as a directed acyclic graph (DAG) - viewing subproblems as vertices on the graph and connecting “smaller subproblems” -\u003e “larger subproblems” with directed edges. This graph will form a directed acyclic graph (DAG), and the dynamic programming algorithm is the process of traversing the topological order of the DAG 🤔️ Why is it a directed acyclic graph? Firstly, directed edges represent the dependency between subproblems and also indicate the order in which we solve the subproblems: to solve a subproblem, we need to solve smaller subproblems first. Secondly, it must be acyclic because dynamic programming remembers the subproblems that have been solved, and we cannot solve the same subproblem multiple times, so it must be acyclic Understanding that order of solving subproblems in dynamic programming is the topological sorting of a DAG is very helpful in understanding tree DP problems. To solve a DP problem, we need to solve subproblems first. In the context of tree DP, the concepts of “subtree” and “subproblem” are equivalent. Therefore, solving subproblems first means calculating dp[r.left] and dp[r.right] before calculating dp[r], which follows the post-order traversal order of a binary tree. Therefore, tree DP problems are often implemented through post-order traversal. If the tree is viewed as a graph (with directed edges pointing from child nodes to parent nodes), then the topological sorting is also in correspondence with the post-order traversal order 🤔️ When writing code, you may be unsure of how to update subproblems in the correct order.

At the heart of this process lies the backpropagation algorithm, which facilitates efficient computation of gradients across the network To better understand this concept, let us recall the formula for gradient descent. In this formula, we utilize the symbol $\\theta$ to represent all the learnable parameters of the model, $J$ to represent the cost or loss function, and $\\alpha$ to denote the learning rate. Thus, we can express the updating process as: $$ \\theta \\leftarrow \\theta - \\alpha * \\frac{\\partial J}{\\partial \\theta} $$ To optimize the model continuously, it’s crucial to calculate the gradient $\\frac{\\partial J}{\\partial \\theta}$ accurately and efficiently through backpropagation.

Based on this, we can deduce that the dimensionality of $W^2$ and $W^3$ are as follows: $W^2\\in \\mathcal{R}^{h\\times n}$ $W^3\\in \\mathcal{R}^{k\\times h}$ $b_j^l$ represents the bias term of the $j$-th neuron of the layer $l$ $z_j^l$ represents the weighted output of the $j$ neuron of the layer $l$ $a_j^l$ represents the output after the activation function of the $j$-th neuron in the layer $l$ With these terms defined, we can formulate the process of forward propagation in a neural network as follows: $$ z_j^2 = \\sum_kw_{jk}^2x^1_k+b_j^2 $$ $$ a_j^2=\\sigma(z_j^2) $$ $$ z_j^3 = \\sum_kw_{jk}^3a_k^2+b_j^3 $$ $$ a_j^3=\\sigma(z_j^3) $$ Let’s generalize $z_j^l$ and $a_j^l$: $$ z_j^l=\\sum_kw_{jk}^la^{l-1}_k+b_j^l $$ $$ a_j^l=\\sigma(z_j^l) $$ The above two formulas are very important, they will be very useful in the derivation of the four formulas of backpropagation Here we consider using the mean squared error (MSE) as the cost or loss function $J$ and the $sigmoid$ function as the activation function. Of course, the derivation process is similar if we use different cost/loss function and activation function $$ J = \\frac{1}{2k}\\sum_{j=1}^k(a_j^L-y_j)^2 $$ ","date":"2023-04-04","objectID":"/en/backpropagation-tutorial/:2:0","series":null,"tags":["Deep-Learning"],"title":"How to understand the backpropagation algorithm","uri":"/en/backpropagation-tutorial/#define-a-model"},{"categories":["ML-DL"],"content":" The intuition of backpropagationUnderstanding a concept at a high level before delving into its details is always beneficial. In the context of deep learning, the goal of the training process is to minimize the error between the predicted value $a^L_j$ and the actual label $y_j$ for each sample. By calculating this error, we can determine whether to increase or decrease $a^L_j$ to improve the model’s predictions. However, we can only adjust $a^L_j$ by modifying the weights $w^L_{jk}$ between the $L-1$ layer and the output layer, the bias term $b_j^L$, or the output value $a^{L-1}_k$ after the activation function in the $L-1$ layer.

Surprisingly, I can still learn a lot, so I decided to write some posts👍. To talk about linear regression, we must first have a basic understanding of what is machine learning. What is machine learning? abstractly speaking, machine learning is learning a function: $$ f(input) = output $$ where $f$ refers to the specific machine learning model. Machine learning is a methodology for automatically mining the relationship between input and output. Sometimes we find it hard to define a specific algorithm to solve some problems, and this is where machine learning shines, we can let it learn and summarize some patterns from data and make predictions. This is also where it differs from traditional algorithms (binary search, recursive, etc.). One has to admit that machine learning is fascinating by definition, and it seems to provide a viable framework for solving all intractable problems. It just so happens that many real-life problems are so hard that solving them with traditional algorithms is impossible. 📒 That’s why I always feel that every programmer should know some machine learning/deep learning, it is a great tool for us to solve problems💪 Linear regression is one of the classic machine learning models. In my opinion, it can be regarded as the counterpart of “Hello world” in the machine learning world. In the previous formula, $input$ is the so-called feature in machine learning, which is often represented by the symbol $x$. And $output$ can be roughly divided into two categories: class/category (Classification problem) and number (Regression problem). 📒 How to understand features? The so-called features are characteristics that are highly correlated with the target to be predicted. Take predicting housing prices as an example. The housing price is obviously related to the house area, distance to the downtown, etc. The house area here is a feature. In machine learning, we can analyze the importance of different features to see which ones are highly correlated with the output, or use our domain knowledge (Domain knowledge) to choose good features wisely. But in general, machine learning still requires us to spend a lot of time spotting good features. This is the drawback of machine learning, and this shortcoming is greatly alleviated in deep learning. Of course, that is not the topic today. 📒 Machine learning cannot magically understand the various formats of $input$ you provide, such as images, text, videos, etc.. In machine learning, $input$ is often processed as numbers, so that they can be learned by various machine learning algorithms. Some features are numbers themselves, such as the house area we previously talked about. When the input is not transformered into numbers, we needed to invent some procedure to do so, such as using a word embedding vector model to represent text, etc., and I will not go into details here. Let’s assume that the input has been processed into numbers below. The topic of this post, the linear regression model, belongs to the regression model in the supervised learning domain. It is a simple model, but it can explain a lot of machine learning ideas, which makes it a perfect choice to get started. Without further ado, let’s get started :) 📒 This article assumes that you have a basic understanding of matrix/vector calculus, for example, you need to know the definition of matrix multiplication, how to calculate derivatives, etc. ","date":"2023-03-15","objectID":"/en/linear-regression-model-guide-theory/:1:0","series":null,"tags":["Machine-Learning"],"title":"Linear Regression Model Guide - theory part","uri":"/en/linear-regression-model-guide-theory/#introduction"},{"categories":["ML-DL"],"content":" Linear regression modelAs the name suggests, it consists of two parts: Linear.

Obviously, we wish to minimize the “distance” between the predicted value and the actual value. In machine learning, we will specify a cost function to measure the “distance”. The lower the cost, the better. When the cost of the model on the validation set is minimized to a small value and no longer changes significantly, we think that the model has converged, and the best model is obtained at this time 📒 In machine learning, the data is usually divided into training/validation/test set, the model learns on the training set, verifies and adjusts parameters on the validation set, and performs generalization verification on the test set finally (The test set contains unseen data). It is incorrect to directly adjust parameters on the test set by only using the division method of training/test set. The test set is used if and only if after you finish training and tuning your model The most commonly used cost function of the linear regression model is the mean square error function(MSE). Its formula is as follows: $$ MSE=\\frac{1}{2m}\\sum^m_{i=1}(\\hat y^{(i)} - y^{(i)})^2 $$ where $m$ represents the number of samples The superscript ${(i)}$ is different from exponent marks. ${(i)}$ indicates the predicted/true value of the $i$th sample $\\hat y$ represents the prediction of the linear regression model, and $y$ represents the original true value 📒 I use notations that conforms to machine learning conventions~ 📒 Linear regression model does not have to use MSE though, you can also use the absolute value error(MAE).

But how to make the model continuously improve the prediction and reduce the cost? 🤔 The Gradient descent algorithm is a general practice Don’t be fooled by the name, the gradient descent algorithm is not that mysterious. Let’s recap what we have learned so far: The prediction $\\hat y$ of the model is related to its parameters, if it is a univariate linear regression model, it is related to $w$ and $b$ The cost function is related to the prediction of the model because we cannot change the real value of the data So The cost function is a function about the model parameters. In machine learning, it is usually denoted by $J$. Consider first simple univariate linear regression when it uses MSE as the cost function: $$ J(w, b) = \\frac{1}{2m}\\sum^m_{i=1}(f(x^{(i)})-y^{(i)})^2 = \\frac{1}{2m}\\sum^m_{i=1}(wx^{(i)} + b - y^{(i)})^2 $$ By changing the values of $w$ and $b$, the cost $J(w,b)$ will change accordingly, so improving the linear regression model is adjusting these two parameters so that $J(w, b)$ reaches its minimum. In the language of mathematics, solving the optimal model is solving the minimum point of the function $J(w,b)$ 📒 Recall that $m$ is the number of samples in the training set. More strictly speaking, the above gradient descent formula is batch gradient descent, that is, every calculation of the gradient uses samples from the entire training set. When the training set is very large, this method cannot scale well. At this time, we need to use stochastic gradient descent. 📒 If you are good at mathematics, it is not difficult for you to find the minimum value of the above formula. But this is because the linear regression model is relatively simple, when the model becomes more complicated, it will be more difficult to solve it with mathematical methods. In practice, we use the gradient descent algorithms all the time in the machine learning world (reinforcement learning is an exception, for the goal of reinforcement learning optimization is generally not a differentiable function) Let us forget $b$ temporarily and only consider $w$, then $J$ is a function about $w$ at this time. We can take $w$ as the horizontal axis, and $J(w)$ as the vertical axis, which gives us the following plot 📒 Note that the above diagram does not strictly follow the definition of $J(w)$. For convenience, I directly draw $y=\\frac{1}{2}x^2$ here. But the shape should be similar, which can be used to understand the gradient descent algorithm. It is trivial to find out from the figure that $J(w)$ reaches its minimum when $w=0$. Assuming that the model’s current parameter $w$ is $5$, we can calculate the cost as $J(5)=12.5$. How do we update $w$ to minimize the cost? The solution is to let $w$ update along the opposite direction of the gradient (the red line in the figure is the tangent at the point $w=5$), it is not difficult to compute the gradient/derivative at this point, which is $5$, $w$ should be reduced, so it should minus this gradient (that’s why we say opposite direction). We also introduce learning rate $\\alpha$ to control the step size, which give us the update formula $w \\leftarrow w - \\alpha \\cdot 5$ 📒 Intuition: Imagine yourself standing at the point of $w=5$ and want to reach the minimum. If the learning rate $\\alpha$ is too large, your new position $w$ may be less than $0$. You will find that you suddenly crossed the minimum. Although you can try to update again through gradient descent, at this time you will often find that the loss of your model has been changing and cannot converge. The learning rate and the gradient jointly control the magnitude of each parameter update 📒 We concluded how to update when only considering $w$ - along the opposite direction of the gradient.

To keep things organized, I prefer to break it down into smaller, more manageable parts. If you follow this post to configure your Nvim, your ~/.config/nvim should look like this⬇️ text nvim ├── init.lua └── lua ├── colorscheme.lua ├── config │ └── nvim-cmp.lua ├── keymaps.lua ├── lsp.lua ├── options.lua └── plugins.lua The explanations init.lua is the entry point.

For example, nvim-cmp.lua for the nvim-cmp plugin lua folder. When we call require to import a module in Lua, it will search this folder.

Python use the “duck typing” design, which means that the type of an object is not as important as its behavior. This feature allows for faster development and a reduction in burdensome type declarations. Additionally, the support of powerful third-party libraries solidifies Python as my preferred programming language.😺 However, with the proposal of PEP 4841, Python decided to introduce type hints, which seem to be in line with statically typed languages. It’s not true though, Python’s type hints are optional, and it has no runtime effect. It seems that writing this blog post specifically to introduce Python’s type hints is unnecessary, but I have found that using them in my code still provides several benefits: Static type checker can check your code. For example, Mypy The code completion in IDE will become more intelligent. It will also report a bug if we use the wrong APIs. This is probably the biggest motivation for me to choose to write type hints Manage code complexity. Type hints expose useful information about APIs.

I have covered some of the most common and practical uses of type hints that I have found useful.

Personally, I follow the strategy of using type hints only when the added benefits outweigh the potential added complexity. In situations where the type hints become too complex, I choose not to use them unless it is deemed necessary. I will also give you some advice based on my experiences🎯: When you decide what to add, try to think what this type it can do8. The static protocols8 are well suited to this requirement. This makes me think of the traits in Rust :) Always make the return type as precise as possible. Just try to imagine that a function returns Union[str, int]. We have to check it manually, which makes me fell like the type hints are a little unnecessary. Even if you pass the type checker, you are not free of bugs.

The main advantages in my opinion are: Expressions can be embedded in the string literals conveniently More human-readable The following simple comparison shows the advantages of f-strings in readability: python name = \"Martin\" f\"My name is {name}\" 'My name is Martin' python name = \"Martin\" \"My name is %s\" % name 'My name is Martin' We implemented the same string output in two different ways.

Walrus operator is expression though. The difference between statement and expression can be simply understood as: expression always returns a value, while statement does not return a value. The difference between the two can be seen in the following code: python # `=` is a statement, so it will print no value x = 5 python # `:=` is an expression, so it will evaluate to a value # not recommended :) (x := 5) 5 📒 The () needs to be added to avoid confusion. According to the Zen of Python: “There should be one– and preferably only one –obvious way to do it.”. If we can use it without (), we definitely will be confused about which one to use 🤕️ In C/C++, = is an expression. We can write this: c // = will store the value in the LHS(left-hand-side) variable. // , and it has the value of the LHS // so we store the result of `foo` function call to `a` // , then we check if `a` \u003e 0 while ( (a = foo(...)) \u003e 0 ) { ... } Before Python 3.8, it was not possible to do something similar.

The most convenient thing about walrus expressions is: dealing with functions whose return value may be None To deal with functions that may return None, we will usually first use the = statement to save the return result of the function. Then we check if it is None so we can refer to it later safely python some_thing = foo(....) if some_thing: ... else: ... I will use the re as an example python import re # define a regex pattern to extract digits in a string DIGIT_PATTERN = r'\\d+' text = 'There are 10 dogs' # re.search will return None if no match was found. match = re.search(DIGIT_PATTERN, text) if match: # group(0) will return the entire match print(f\"Find match: {match.group(0)}\") else: print(\"Not match was found\") Find match: 10 To avoid getting an AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'group' error when using match.group() later, we have to use an intermediate variable match to temporarily hold the return value rather then chain them together: re.search(DIGIT_PATTERN, text).group(0). It may seem kind of redundant though. 📒 In Rust, the return type that may return None is called Option\u003cT\u003e. We can use ? to handle this situation, it will try to extract the value inside, and if it fails it will terminate early with an error. So in Rust, we can do this (assuming Rust has a similar API): re.search(DIGIT_PATTERN, text)?.group(0) 🍺 The readability is slightly weaker in my opinion, of course, this is quite personal. i.e. We can only use the match variable when match is not None. There is no chance to use it inside the else branch. However, if we look at the code from the top down quickly, match = ... on a separate line is like the match can be used later everywhere 🤣 Instead, we can use := to bind its return value here: python if match := re.search(DIGIT_PATTERN, text): # group(0) will return the entire match print(f\"Find match: {match.group(0)}\") else: print(\"Not match was found\") Find match: 10 1 One of the reasons for supporting := is that research shows that developers tend to write fewer lines of code rather than shorter code. That’s what we did here. At the same time, we can see the scope of match at a glance 👏 Similarly, we can use this feature in while loops too: python val = foo(...) while val: # do something while val is not None val = foo(...)

If they are equal, the statements inside the specific case and all the case after the matched case will be executed, unless it finds a break statement. This feature is called Fall through, and we can use this feature to stack multiple case statements together to represent a logical “or” relationship The default branch will be executed when all the previous case branches fail to match Python does not provide a switch statement, but we can use if...elif..elif..else to achieve the same effect, for example, suppose we want to perform different operations depending on the length of the list, We can write this: python some_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] if len(some_list) == 1: # do something when the length is 1 ... # or more pythonic way: elif len(some_list) in [3, 5]: elif len(some_list) == 3 or len(some_list) == 5: # do something when the length is 3 or 5 ... else: ... The above series of if...elif..elif..else is actually slightly less readable, and it also violates the DRY(Don’t repeat yourself) principle, we write len(some_list) many times. Of course, we can choose to use a variable length to remember the length of some_list first, so that we can type less code. However, if the situation is more complicated, this trick is not applicable. A more elegant way to handle this situation is what this article is about: Pattern matching ⬇️ python match len(some_list): case 1: # do something when the length is 1 ... case 3 | 5: # do something when the length is 3 or 5 ... case _: # equal to the `default:` ...

Fortunately, python provides us with syntactic sugar 🍬 python some_list = [\"foo\", 1, 3.14] match some_list: # match with type constraints case [str(s), int(v1), float(v2)]: print(f'Match {s} - {v1} - {v2}') Match foo - 1 - 3.14 ","date":"2022-10-16","objectID":"/en/pattern-matching-in-python/:3:6","series":null,"tags":["Python"],"title":"Pattern Matching in Python 3.10","uri":"/en/pattern-matching-in-python/#class-pattern"},{"categories":["Programming-Languages"],"content":" Mapping patternThe previous ones are all matching against a sequence, here we are matching against the dict.

But in fact, Python also allows us to use pattern matching on objects of our own custom classes. Considering the application scenario, when we use pattern matching on an object, we often want to check whether the object is a certain class type. We may also care about some of its fields and want to extract the values. But in Python, this is difficult to implement1, mainly because the class has a lot of fields, most of which are special methods like __repr__, and these fields are unordered. Because it is unordered, we can’t directly bind variables by position in pattern, see the following example: python class Point: \"\"\" A simple class represents a Point in a 2D\"\"\" def __init__(x: int, y: int): self.x = x self.y = y some_point = Point(1, 2) match some_point: # the intuitive way, we want to match a Point type # , and we want to bind the `x` and `y` and their two fields respectively case Point(x, y): print(f\"The x: {x}\") print(f\"The y: {y}\") --------------------------------------------------------------------------- TypeError Traceback (most recent call last) Input In [17], in \u003ccell line: 7\u003e() 4 self.x = x 5 self.y = y ----\u003e 7 some_point = Point(1, 2) 9 match some_point: 10 # the intuitive way, we want to match a Point type 11 # , and we want to bind the `x` and `y` and their two fields respectively 12 case Point(x, y): 13 print(f\"The x: {x}\") 14 print(f\"The y: {y}\") TypeError: Point.__init__() takes 2 positional arguments but 3 were given Python provides two solutions, which are syntactically very similar to calling a function: we can choose to pass arguments by position, or we can choose to use the form foo=bar Let’s talk about the simple one first: add constraints by using foo=bar, which means that the object should have a field called foo and we want to bind bar to it. python class Point: \"\"\" A simple class represents a Point in a 2D\"\"\" def __init__(self, x: int, y: int): self.x = x self.y = y some_point = Point(1, 2) match some_point: # the intuitive way, we want to match a Point type # , and we want to bind the `x` and `y` and their two fields respectively case Point(x=x, y=y): print(f\"The x: {x}\") print(f\"The y: {y}\") The x: 1 The y: 2 Another solution is to modify the __match_args__ attribute of the class, which specifies the order of the fields python class Point: \"\"\" A simple class represents a Point in a 2D\"\"\" # we tell python that the order is first \"x\" and then \"y\" __match_args__ = (\"x\", \"y\") def __init__(self, x: int, y: int): self.x = x self.y = y some_point = Point(1, 2) match some_point: # the intuitive way, we want to match a Point type # , and we want to bind the `x` and `y` and their two fields respectively case Point(x, y): print(f\"The x: {x}\") print(f\"The y: {y}\") The x: 1 The y: 2 if you are familiar with @dataclass2, you can do this: python from dataclasses import dataclass @dataclass(match_args=True) class Point: \"\"\" A simple class represents a Point in a 2D\"\"\" x: int y: int print(f\"The order is {Point.__match_args__}\") some_point = Point(1, 2) match some_point: # the intuitive way, we want to match a Point type # , and we want to bind the `x` and `y` and their two fields respectively case Point(x, y): print(f\"The x: {x}\") print(f\"The y: {y}\") The order is ('x', 'y') The x: 1 The y: 2 ","date":"2022-10-16","objectID":"/en/pattern-matching-in-python/:4:0","series":null,"tags":["Python"],"title":"Pattern Matching in Python 3.10","uri":"/en/pattern-matching-in-python/#use-pattern-matching-on-a-class"},{"categories":["Programming-Languages"],"content":" GuardSometimes we not only care about whether the pattern matches, but we also want to impose certain restrictions.

Because these languages have garbage collectors (GCs) that will automatically manage memory for you, you just need to program at a high level without considering the details. The bad news is that GC is not a cost-free design. No matter how well designed a GC algorithm is, the performance of the code will be degraded to some extent. If you have been in programming for a long time, you may have heard something like “the recursion explodes the stack”. You may or may not click on the search engine to understand the difference between stack and heap. Chances are you just clicked into this article :) 📒 Although GC will degrade the performance, it removes the mental burden of manually managing memory for developers, which can greatly speed up software development. This is sacrificing performance for development speed. However, when the performance bottleneck occurs in the later stage of the software, it is necessary to study how to refactor or even rewrite the key parts of code to improve performance. The stack and heap I mentioned here are not the heap and stack in the data structure, but the two mechanisms of memory management. Understanding the detailed differences between stack and heap helps us understand some programming languages that are closer to the low-level, such as Rust, C, C++, etc. In Rust, the most important concept is ownership. Mastering the ownership can make you feel easier when you are learning other designs in rust😄.

After understanding this, you will get a better understanding when you see that the sp pointer is got subtracted in the assembly code. 📒 It seems that as we allocate more and more memory, the stack and heap may collide (because they are getting closer to each other). However, there is no need to worry about this problem, because: 1) This layout is happening in virtual memory. Today’s processors are generally 64-bit, and the capacity is very large. 2) Before the conflict, it is very likely that your physical memory has been exhausted long ago, this should be your first concern.

For example, in Python, you can use sys.getrecursionlimit() to modify the size limit of the stack.

Hopefully understanding this will make it easier for you to learn pointers. :) Unlike simply modifying the sp value on stack allocation, memory management on the heap is much more complicated. Including the following points: The location and size of the memory that can be allocated on the heap are arbitrary (within the physical memory size limit), we need to invent some algorithm and data structure to trace the usage. This brings great difficulties to memory management on the heap. The efficiency of allocating space on the heap is also relatively low. We need to find a space of sufficient size. This process of finding is more time-consuming than directly modifying the value of sp. We must also deal with the problem of “fragmentation”. Because the allocated space on the heap is scattered everywhere, a lot of fragments will be left in the memory in the process of heap allocation. The extreme case is: the total size of the fragments meets your requirements, but because they are scattered all over the memory and cannot be used together, the program throws an out-of-memory warning. 📒 The memory that can be allocated on the heap is way larger than the stack, but better management mechanisms are needed to handle this more complex situation. For developers, it also causes a certain burden. We can’t rely on the compiler to automatically handle it for us, we have to manage the memory manually.

The reason why the stack is called the stack is because we follow the classical LIFO pattern when we manage the memory on the stack, and the name of the heap implies disorganization. Generally speaking, it is more efficient to allocate and free memory space on the stack. For this reason, Rust operates on the stack by default. Data of “fixed size” is generally placed on the stack, and data of “variable size” is generally placed on the heap. However, sometimes for performance considerations, fixed-size data can also be stored on the heap. In the subject of CS, you can often see the layered design. For example, OSI model in the computer network. Programming languages themselves can also be divided into high-level languages and low-level languages. I would like to share with you a sentence from a performance engineering teacher1 - “Many times, if you want to learn this level well, you must understand the underlying level. You don’t have to work at that level, but after knowing the details of that level. It will help you learn this level quite well”. At least for me, after knowing the difference between stack and heap, the following questions seem to me to have a very reasonable explanation: What are pointers in C/C++ language used for? Why do they exist? Why does tail recursion optimization exist? Why do we have to consider the problem of deep recursion when writing recursive functions? Why does Rust put data on the stack by default? Why did I see someone recommend passing references when implementing a function? 📒 In my humble opinion, the abstraction layer design is the most important concept in CS. Should you choose a language with GC that is easy to use but less efficient, or choose to manually manage memory yourself to make your code more efficient? It depends on the job at hand. If you want to develop speed, of course, it is the former, and if you focus on performance, it is the latter. Of course, in the middle is no GC + basically no need to manually manage memory by yourself + efficient = Rust language 🚀. Why not learn some Rust 😉 ⚠️ Some details are ignored when I write this article. I only wrote down what I think is important. If you want to learn more, you may check the refs.

A symbol table should meet the following characteristics: Efficient query Efficient insertion Record the scope of the variable It is not difficult to figure out that the data structure that supports efficient query and insertion is the “hash table”. To maintain the scope of variables, We can put variables in the same hash table, and use a list to remember all scopes. The structure should be like: [{scope1} , {scope2},...]. In order to remember the current scope, I use the self.current_scope variable. Whenever a new scope appears, save the current scope and insert a new scope into the list. Don’t forget to update the self.current_scope also. 📒Conceptually, the list here is a stack 🤔What method are we going to implement? lookup(identifier, value): Insert a variable into the current symbol table. According to the requirements of this assignment, we should also query whether the variable has been declared before enter_new_scope(): Save the current symbol table, enter the new scope, and initialize it. exit_scope(): Clear the current symbol table and find the previous symbol table(the top of the stack) So the corresponding code in @parser::members are as follows python @parser::members { def init(self): self.current_scope = None self.block_count = 0 self.warning_list = [] # just for printing self.output_list = [] # just for printing self.declaration_error = '' def enter_new_scope(self): if not hasattr(self, '_scopes'): setattr(self, '_scopes', []) # save the current_scope import copy if len(self._scopes) \u003e 0: self._scopes.append(copy.deepcopy(self.current_scope)) self._scopes.append({}) self.current_scope = self._scopes[-1] def exit_scope(self): del self._scopes[-1] if len(self._scopes) \u003e 0: self.current_scope = self._scopes[-1] def lookup(self, identifier, value): # check all scopes found = False for scope in self._scopes[:-1][::-1]: #print(f\"the scope: {scope}\") if identifier in scope: found = True if found: self.warning_list.append(f\"SHADOW WARNING {identifier}\") # only record the 1st declaration error if identifier in self.current_scope and self.declaration_error == '': self.declaration_error = f\"DECLARATION ERROR {identifier}\" self.current_scope[identifier] = value } ","date":"2022-05-28","objectID":"/en/how-to-use-antlr4-to-make-semantic-actions/:4:1","series":null,"tags":["Compiler","Course"],"title":"How to use the semantic actions to generate the symbol tables in ANTLR4","uri":"/en/how-to-use-antlr4-to-make-semantic-actions/#what-data-structure-should-i-use"},{"categories":["Compiler"],"content":" Inject actions into the grammar rule🤔The next step is to inject actions into the corresponding grammar rules. We want to output relevant information when variable declarations happen, so we must first observe what the rules of variable declaration in the Micro language are. The corresponding grammar rules are as follows antlr ... var_decl : var_type id_list ';' ; var_type : 'FLOAT' | 'INT' ; any_type : var_type | 'VOID' ; id_list : id id_tail ; id_tail : ',' id id_tail | ; ... As you can see, the var_decl rule shows the basic structure to declare variables.

Apparently, the time complexity and space complexity are both $O(n)$ Try to sort the array, because the element we are looking for exceeds the half-length of the array, which means it must appear in the middle of the array after sorting. However, although the space complexity is $O( 1)$, the time complexity is still greater than $O(n)$. For example, if you use quicksort, the time complexity is $O(nlogn)$ So is there a way to achieve a time complexity of $O(n)$ and a space complexity of $O(1)$? That is to combine the advantages of the above two methods. Yes, the answer is the Boyer-Moore Majority Voting Algorithm!

Algorithm: Choose one of these $n$ elements as a candidate and record its votes as votes = 1. At this point there are $n-1$ elements in our array, we take out one element each time (denoted as current), and repeat the following steps (a total of n-1 times) Compare it to our current candidate, if they have the same value, then votes++, which is an affirmative vote If their values are different, votes--, that is, a dissenting vote. If we get votes = 0 at this time, then candidate \u003c- current, which means that we make current the new candidate, and reset votes = 1 The final value of the candidate is maybe the element that appears more than half of the times we want, at this point, we have to traverse the array again to check if it is After reading the above algorithm procedure, you may be as confused as I was. Why do we finally find the elements with more than half of the occurrences? In order to answer this question, we need to understand this: 💡 If there is an element that appears more than $\\lfloor n/2\\rfloor$ times, then the other elements in the array must appear less than $\\lfloor n/2\\rfloor$ in all. Why it is useful? ⬆️ Because what this algorithm does is actually voting: It can be an affirmative vote, which is equal to the occurrences times of this element It can be a dissenting vote, which is equivalent to canceling one affirmative vote But the number of votes (affirmative votes) for the elements that appear more than $\\lfloor n/2\\rfloor$ times \u003e the remaining all that are not (dissenting votes) is always to be true, so no matter what, the final winner will always be the element we are searching(if it exists) :) To get a intuitive understanding ⬇️ ","date":"2022-03-24","objectID":"/en/boyer-moore-majority-voting-algorithm-explained/:3:0","series":null,"tags":["Algorithm"],"title":"Boyer-Moore Majority Voting Algorithm Explained","uri":"/en/boyer-moore-majority-voting-algorithm-explained/#boyer-moore-majority-voting-algorithm"},{"categories":["Algorithm"],"content":" Code java class Solution { public int majorityElement(int[] nums) { if (nums.length \u003c 2) { return nums[0]; } int candidates = nums[0]; int votes = 1; // step 1. start to vote for (int i = 0; i \u003c nums.length; i++) { if (nums[i] != candidates) { votes -= 1; if (votes == 0) { candidates = nums[i]; votes = 1; } } else { votes += 1; } } // step2. check int occurs = 0; for (var val: nums) { if (candidates == val) { occurs += 1; } } if (occurs \u003e= nums.length / 2) { return candidates; } else { return -1; } } } ","date":"2022-03-24","objectID":"/en/boyer-moore-majority-voting-algorithm-explained/:4:0","series":null,"tags":["Algorithm"],"title":"Boyer-Moore Majority Voting Algorithm Explained","uri":"/en/boyer-moore-majority-voting-algorithm-explained/#code"},{"categories":["Algorithm"],"content":" FAQ Q: Why do you need a second round of for-loop?

It cannot hit Bees that are in the same Place as it or the first 4 Places in front of it. If there are two Bees, one too close to the LongThrower and the other within its range, the LongThrower should only throw at the farther Bee, which is within its range, instead of trying to hit the closer Bee. The ShortThrower can only throw_at a Bee that is found after following at most 3 entrance transitions. It cannot throw at any bees further than 3 Places in front of it. Neither of these specialized throwers can throw_at a Bee that is exactly 4 Places away. Now we have to implement two classes, LongThrower and ShortThrower.

In order to determine whether an Insect is waterproof, add a new class attribute to the Insect class named is_waterproof that is set to False.

The queen is a waterproof ScubaThrower that inspires her fellow ants through her bravery. In addition to the standard ScubaThrower action, the QueenAnt doubles the damage of all the ants behind her each time she performs an action. Once an ant’s damage has been doubled, it is not doubled again for subsequent turns. However, with great power comes great responsibility. The QueenAnt is governed by three special rules: If the queen ever has its health reduced to 0, the ants lose. You will need to override Ant.reduce_health in QueenAnt and call ants_lose() in that case in order to signal to the simulator that the game is over. (The ants also still lose if any bee reaches the end of a tunnel.) There can be only one queen. A second queen cannot be constructed. To check if an Ant can be constructed, we use the Ant.construct() class method to either construct an Ant if possible, or return None if not. You will need to override Ant.construct as a class method of QueenAnt in order to add this check. To keep track of whether a queen has already been created, you can use an instance variable added to the current GameState. The queen cannot be removed. Attempts to remove the queen should have no effect (but should not cause an error). You will need to override Ant.remove_from in QueenAnt to enforce this condition. Finally, we came to the last question (except the extra questions), we have to implement a queen ant🐜. It has the following features: It can be placed in water Thought: The description also said that it is a kind of ScrubaThrower After it moves, it will double the attack power of the ants behind it, but not multiple times!!! Thought: How to express the relationship of “behind”? From the previous topic, we know the colony is a double linked list. The right side is the positive direction, so “behind” is actually corresponding to the left side. We can access the .exit method of Place to get all the ants behind. Thought: How to indicate that it cannot be doubled multiple times? It is easy to think that we need to set a flag to indicate whether the current ant has doubled its attack power. So we can directly add an instance variable to the Ant class Thought: Pay attention to how to deal with the GuardAnt here, because the ant it contains may be replaced by a new one. At this time we have to double the attack power of this new ant inside. There can only be one queen ant🐜 Thought: How to make it possible that even if we call the constructor of queen ants 🐜 many times, there will be exactly only one queen ant🐜? This depends on a class called GameState. We can add a has_queen variable to the GameState class to indicate whether the queen ant🐜 has been created. Queen Ant 🐜 cannot be removed That’s easy. The final code is probably as follows: python class QueenAnt(ScubaThrower): \"\"\"The Queen of the colony.

This “status” lasts for a certain number of turns, after which it ceases to take effect. We will be implementing two new ants that inherit from ThrowerAnt. SlowThrower throws sticky syrup at a bee, slowing it for 3 turns. When a bee is slowed, it can only move on turns when gamestate.time is even, and can do nothing otherwise. If a bee is hit by syrup while it is already slowed, it is slowed for an additional 3 turns. ScaryThrower intimidates a nearby bee, causing it to back away instead of advancing. (If the bee is already right next to the Hive and cannot go back further, it should not move. To check if a bee is next to the Hive, you might find the is_hive instance attribute of Places useful). Bees remain scared until they have tried to back away twice. Bees cannot try to back away if they are slowed and gamestate.time is odd. Once a bee has been scared once, it can’t be scared ever again. Implement two special types of ants, which do no damage themselves, but add debuffs to bees. SlowThrower can slow down the bees, so that they can only move forward when the current time is even. This effect can last for 3 turns, but **we can slow the bees as many times as we want. ScaryThrower will make the bee move back(if you can’t move back, just keep still). This effect lasts for 2 turns. But if it is slowed, it will continue to stay still. This kind of debuff only can last time This question, really, is completely difficult. I debug the code for a long time before I succeeded. Let me talk about the design ideas: SlowThrower Set the is_slow variable to indicate whether the current bee is being slowed down, and set another variable called slow_turns to remember how many turns left to cancel this state Every turn, if the current bee is slowed down, it needs to check if the current gametime is an even number, if it is, it can move forward, otherwise stay in place, but no matter if you are moving, slow_turns -= 1 forever established ScaryThrower is_scared and scared_turns are set like is_slow and slow_turns Firstly, we don’t consider whether the current bee is slowed down for now (it’s easier to think about it this way). Obviously, what we need to do every turn is to let scared_turns -= 1, and the is_scared state actually determines the bee’s destination. Now, we will add more complexity to this. It’s problematic that we didn’t consider whether we were being slowed down. The description says that if it is slowed down while it is in scared state, it will keep still in its place. However, we let scared_turns -= 1 anyway, so we need to add one more judgment here, that is, in the case of being decelerated + being scared, if we do not move successfully, then we need to undo our changes to scared_turns The code is as follows: python class Bee(Insect): \"\"\"A Bee moves from place to place, following exits and stinging ants.\"\"\" name = 'Bee' damage = 1 is_waterproof = True # 2 flags is_slow = False is_scared = False # turns remained slow_turns = 0 scared_turns = 0 # we can't scare a bee twice has_been_scared = False def action(self, gamestate): \"\"\"A Bee's action stings the Ant that blocks its exit if it is blocked, or moves to the exit of its current place otherwise. gamestate -- The GameState, used to access game state information. \"\"\" if self.is_scared: destination = self.place.entrance self.scared_turns -= 1 else: destination = self.place.exit if self.is_slow: self.slow_turns -= 1 if self.slow_turns == 0: self.is_slow = False if gamestate.time % 2 == 0 and self.health \u003e 0 and destination is not None: self.move_to(destination) elif self.is_scared: # is_slow + is_scared + gamestate.time is odd, we need to cancel `self.scared_turns -= 1` \\ # if we didn't move self.scared_turns += 1 else: if self.blocked(): self.sting(self.place.ant) elif self.health \u003e 0 and destination is not None:","date":"2022-03-10","objectID":"/en/proj3.ants-vs-somebees-of-cs61a-of-ucb/:5:4","series":null,"tags":["Course","Python"],"title":"Solution of Proj3.Ants vs SomeBees of CS61A (2021-Fall)","uri":"/en/proj3.ants-vs-somebees-of-cs61a-of-ucb/#extra-credit-2-pt"},{"categories":["Course"],"content":" Optional Problems ","date":"2022-03-10","objectID":"/en/proj3.ants-vs-somebees-of-cs61a-of-ucb/:6:0","series":null,"tags":["Course","Python"],"title":"Solution of Proj3.Ants vs SomeBees of CS61A (2021-Fall)","uri":"/en/proj3.ants-vs-somebees-of-cs61a-of-ucb/#optional-problems"},{"categories":["Course"],"content":" Optional Problem 1 Implement the NinjaAnt, which damages all Bees that pass by, but can never be stung.

Note who is the subject (useful for later thinking about how to solve it recursively). How to solve it with recursion? base case: We are adding the tree t2 to the tree t1. What if t2 is None, do t2 still need to be added? No, this is one of our base cases 🤗. On the basis that t2 is not None, what if t1 is empty? Obviously, the result of adding two trees at this time is t2, so we can just return t2. recursive decomposition At this time, we can guarantee that t1 and t2 are both non-empty, but we can’t guarantee that they have the same number of children, so we can’t use zip according to the hint. Because when zip is processing the two sequences of different lengths, some elements of the longer one are ignored. The zip_longest in itertools should be used here, and None will be returned if a sequence is already empty. This way we can guarantee that this recursive call will eventually come to the base case we discussed earlier.

A group consists of any regex expression surrounded by parentheses (()). A pipe operator consists of a regex expression, followed by a pipe (|) character, and lastly followed by another regex expression. For example, r\"apples\" would match exactly the phrase “apples” in an input. If we wanted our pattern from before to match “oranges” as well, we could expand our rstring to do so using groupings and pipes: r\"(apples)|(oranges)\".

A class expression consists of any number of characters or character ranges surrounded by square brackets ([]).

Your job in this part is to write the parsing functionality, which consists of two mutually recursive functions:scheme_read and read_tail. Each function takes in a single src parameter, which is a Buffer instance. scheme_read removes enough tokens from src to form a single expression and returns that expression in the correct internal representation. read_tail expects to read the rest of a list or Pair, assuming the open parenthesis of that list or Pair has already been removed by scheme_read. It will read expressions (and thus remove tokens) until the matching closing parenthesis ) is seen. This list of expressions is returned as a linked list of Pair instances. In short, scheme_read returns the next single complete expression in the buffer and read_tail returns the rest of a list or Pair in the buffer. Both functions mutate the buffer, removing the tokens that have already been processed. The behavior of both functions depends on the first token currently in src. They should be implemented as follows: scheme_read: If the current token is the string \"nil\", return the nil object. If the current token is (, the expression is a pair or list. Call read_tail on the rest of src and return its result. If the current token is ', the rest of the buffer should be processed as a quote expression. You will implement this portion in the next problem. If the next token is not a delimiter, then it must be a primitive expression (i.e. a number, boolean). Return it. Provided If none of the above cases apply, raise an error. Provided read_tail: If there are no more tokens, then the list is missing a close parenthesis and we should raise an error. Provided If the token is ), then we’ve reached the end of the list or pair. Remove this token from the buffer and return the nil object. If none of the above cases apply, the next token is the operator in a combination. For example, src could contain + 2 3). To parse this: scheme_read the next complete expression in the buffer. Call read_tail to read the rest of the combination until the matching closing parenthesis.

That means that we need to wrap the expression following ' (which you can get by recursively calling scheme_read) into the quote special form, which is a Scheme list (as with all special forms). In our representation, a Pair represents a Scheme list. You should therefore wrap the expression following ' in a Pair. For example, 'bagel, or [\"'\", \"bagel\"] after being tokenized, should be represented as Pair('quote', Pair('bagel', nil)). '(1 2) (or [\"'\", \"(\", 1, 2, \")\"]) should be represented as Pair('quote', Pair(Pair(1, Pair(2, nil)), nil)). We need to implement the ' in the scheme language.

Consider the list [1, 2, 3]. Here are a few of it’s subsequences [], [1, 3], [2], and [1, 2, 3]. Write a function that takes in a list and returns all possible subsequences of that list. The subsequences should be returned as a list of lists, where each nested list is a subsequence of the original input. In order to accomplish this, you might first want to write a function insert_into_all that takes an item and a list of lists, adds the item to the beginning of each nested list, and returns the resulting list. This problem requires us to write a function which can return all possible subsequences of its input. The hint says that we should implement the insert_into_all function first. We can do this by a simple list comprehension. python def insert_into_all(item, nested_list): \"\"\"Return a new list consisting of all the lists in nested_list, but with item added to the front of each.

Let’s assume we have already calculated the subsequences of the rest part of the input(denoted as tmp). Now the problem becomes - how to generate new subsequences that contain the first element? The answer is: just add the first element to each subsequence in tmp. Then we do list concatenation and return. Finally, what is the base case?

For example, [2, 1, 3], [1, 3, 2], and [3, 2, 1] are some of the permutations of the sequence [1, 2, 3]. Implement gen_perms, a generator function that takes in a sequence seq and returns a generator that yields all permutations of seq. For this question, assume that seq will not be empty. Permutations may be yielded in any order. Note that the doctests test whether you are yielding all possible permutations, but not in any particular order. The built-in sorted function takes in an iterable object and returns a list containing the elements of the iterable in non-decreasing order. Hint: If you had the permutations of all the elements in seq not including the first element, how could you use that to generate the permutations of the full seq? Hint: Remember, it’s possible to loop over generator objects because generators are iterators! This problem asks us to return a generator that will return all the permutations of the list. We can learn from the hint that we need to solve this problem recursively. It’s easy to figure out the base case of this problem: python def gen_perms(seq): if len(seq) \u003c= 1: yield seq ... Now, the problem is how can we break down this problem into simpler ones? We can learn from the hint that we should recursively process elements other than the element in the first position. Try to think about a question like this: If we have already got the permutations of l[1:], what should we do with l[0]. The answer is quite intuitive: we insert l[0] to every possible position in the permutations of l[1:]. For example, we have [2, 3], whose permutations are [[2, 3], [3, 2]]. First, we insert 1 to [2, 3], which give us [1, 2, 3], [2, 1, 3], [2, 3, 1]. Then we repeat the procedure on [3, 2].

Each path should be represented as a list of the labels along that path in the tree. You may yield the paths in any order. We have provided a skeleton for you. You do not need to use this skeleton, but if your implementation diverges significantly from it, you might want to think about how you can get it to fit the skeleton. The problem asks us to yield all possible path leads us to value. Pay a attention to the hint. The template of the code looks like this: python def path_yielder(t, value): \"*** YOUR CODE HERE ***\" for _______________ in _________________: for _______________ in _________________: \"*** YOUR CODE HERE ***\" You can find it that the template is quite similar to the solution in Q1 if you observe it carefully. First, we should ask ourselves the most important question? - What is the base case? Well, apparently, we meet the base case when we encounter the node with the value label. It can be any branch of the current node, so we need to check each branch. When we find the sub-path, we return it and add the label of the current node. For example, check the example in the doctoring. We want all the paths to lead us to 3. First, we start from the root node(1). It has 2 branches - 2 and 5. In the first branch of 1, we can find 3, at this point we yield [3]. When we backtrack to 2, we get the sub-path - [2, 3].

For this problem, we will be writing remainders_generator, which yields a series of generator objects. remainders_generator takes in an integer m, and yields m different generators. The first generator is a generator of multiples of m, i.e. numbers where the remainder is 0. The second is a generator of natural numbers with remainder 1 when divided by m. The last generator yields natural numbers with remainder m - 1 when divided by m. Hint: To create a generator of infinite natural numbers, you can call the naturals function that’s provided in the starter code. Hint: Consider defining an inner generator function. Each yielded generator varies only in that the elements of each generator have a particular remainder when divided by m. What does that tell you about the argument(s) that the inner function should take in? If you have no idea what is the generator in python, you will find it difficult to figure out the solution. I will recommend this article After reading the article aforementioned, we may start to try to solve this problem. What the problem wants are m generators, the ith yielded generator yields natural numbers whose remainder is i when divided by m. If we know how to get the first generator, then we know how to get all the generators. I believe that it is easy to write a function that returns natural numbers whose remainder is i when divided by m. With the help of yield, we don’t need a list to store the numbers(Just like what I did in Q3). python def helper(i, m): num = 1 # loop variable while True: if num % m == i: yield num num += 1 # you can give it a test \u003e\u003e\u003e it = helper(2, 3) \u003e\u003e\u003e next(it) 2 # 2 % 3 == 2 \u003e\u003e\u003e next(it) 5 # 5 % 3 == 2 \u003e\u003e\u003e next(it) 8 # 8 % 3 == 2 Then how can we get a list of generators. for loop !🤗 python def remainders_generator(m): \"\"\" Yields m generators.

Note: You can assume that the iterator t will have a value that appears at least k times in a row. If you are receiving a StopIteration, your repeated function is likely not identifying the correct value. Your implementation should iterate through the items in a way such that if the same iterator is passed into repeated twice, it should continue in the second call at the point it left off in the first. An example of this behavior is in the doctests. We address two important issues in this problem: How to find consecutive k values? We need to set last_val to remember what the previous value was, so that it can be compared with the current value(while we iterate the list). How to ensure that the next call will start from the point it left off in the first? If you have followed the course carefully, you may remember how to do it. We should use a higher-order function, define another function in repeated and bind the iterator to this nested function. This way we can guarantee that we can start from the previous position every time.

This interval arithmetic example is based on a classic problem from Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs, Section 2.1.4. Introduction. Alyssa P. Hacker is designing a system to help people solve engineering problems. One feature she wants to provide in her system is the ability to manipulate inexact quantities (such as measurements from physical devices) with known precision, so that when computations are done with such approximate quantities the results will be numbers of known precision. For example, if a measured quantity x lies between two numbers a and b, Alyssa would like her system to use this range in computations involving x. Alyssa’s idea is to implement interval arithmetic as a set of arithmetic operations for combining “intervals” (objects that represent the range of possible values of an inexact quantity). The result of adding, subracting, multiplying, or dividing two intervals is also an interval, one that represents the range of the result. Alyssa suggests the existence of an abstraction called an “interval” that has two endpoints: a lower bound and an upper bound. She also presumes that, given the endpoints of an interval, she can create the interval using data abstraction. Using this constructor and the appropriate selectors, she defines the following operations: Alyssa’s program is incomplete because she has not specified the implementation of the interval abstraction. She has implemented the constructor for you; fill in the implementation of the selectors. The calculation system of this question is actually used to calculate the resistance. We know that there will be tolerance in the resistor (such as $\\pm5%$), so the real resistance value should be in an interval. This is the interval indicates. The interval is just a list with size 2. To get the lower bound and the upper bound.

That’s a violation too! python def mul_interval(x, y): \"\"\"Return the interval that contains the product of any value in x and any value in y.\"\"\" p1 = lower_bound(x) * lower_bound(y) p2 = lower_bound(x) * upper_bound(y) p3 = upper_bound(x) * lower_bound(y) p4 = upper_bound(x) * upper_bound(y) return interval(min(p1, p2, p3, p4), max(p1, p2, p3, p4)) Interval Subtraction Using a similar approach as mul_interval and add_interval, define a subtraction function for intervals. If you find yourself repeating code, see if you can reuse functions that have already been implemented. This solution is almost identical to the mul_interval. If you are using vim as your editor, you just need to copy the content of mul_interval and use visual mode to select * then press r- to substitute them. python def sub_interval(x, y): \"\"\"Return the interval that contains the difference between any value in x and any value in y.\"\"\" p1 = lower_bound(x) - lower_bound(y) p2 = lower_bound(x) - upper_bound(y) p3 = upper_bound(x) - lower_bound(y) p4 = upper_bound(x) - upper_bound(y) return interval(min(p1, p2, p3, p4), max(p1, p2, p3, p4)) Interval Division Alyssa implements division below by multiplying by the reciprocal of y. A systems programmer looks over Alyssa’s shoulder and comments that it is not clear what it means to divide by an interval that spans zero. Add an assertstatement to Alyssa’s code to ensure that no such interval is used as a divisor: To avoid the divisor span zero, all we have to do is check if lower_bound(y) \u003e 0 🤗 python def div_interval(x, y): \"\"\"Return the interval that contains the quotient of any value in x divided by any value in y.

Important: Use recursion; the tests will fail if you use any assignment statements. (You can however use function definitions if you so wish.) At first, we need to define what is the base case in this problem. Let’s solve this problem from scratch. The iterative solutioin is quite easy and intuitive. We need to track these things⬇️ index(i), we need to count it to n. value(val), we need to keep track of this state. When we count i to n, this is the expected output. direction, this is a variable that is either equal to -1 or 1. We maintain this variable to indicate counting up or counting down. If it is a multiple of 8 or contains the digit 8, we need to change its value. python def pingpong(n): i, direction = 0, 1 val = 0 while i \u003c n: val += direction i += 1 if num_eights(i) \u003e 0 or i % 8 == 0: direction = -direction return val The problem is how to convert this iterative solution to recursive solution. The parameters of this function should be these variables which changes in while loop. The next problem is: what is the base case? Apparently, the base case can be defined as index \u003c 8, then return index. Because in this range, index = value. Then, how can we know what the direction is? If we define direction(n) as the direction when the index = n, we can reason its value from direction(n-1). The base case are quite similar.

Write a recursive function count_coins that takes a positive integer change and returns the number of ways to make change for change using coins. You can use either of the functions given to you: ascending_coin will return the next larger coin denomination from the input, i.e. ascending_coin(5) is 10. descending_coin will return the next smaller coin denomination from the input, i.e. descending_coin(5) is 1.

If you need to keep track of more than one value across recursive calls, consider writing a helper function. Similiar to this implementation, we can slove this problem use tree-recursive function.

Metaprogramming Most makefiles provide a target called clean. This isn’t intended to produce a file called clean, but instead to clean up any files that can be re-built by make. Think of it as a way to “undo” all of the build steps. Implement a clean target for the paper.pdf Makefile above. You will have to make the target phony. You may find the git ls-filessubcommand useful. A number of other very common make targets are listed here. If you check the files in the folder after we run make, you will find that the new files are paper.aux, paper.log, paper.pdf and paper.png. These files are what we want to clean. In order to do this, we can modify Makefile like this ⬇️ makefile paper.pdf: paper.tex plot-data.png pdflatex paper.tex plot-%.png: %.dat plot.py ./plot.py -i $*.dat -o $@ .PHONY: clean cleanall: cleanaux cleanlog cleanpdf cleanpng cleanaux: rm *.aux cleanlog: rm *.log cleanpdf: rm *.pdf cleanpng: rm *.png Take a look at the various ways to specify version requirements for dependencies in Rust’s build system. Most package repositories support similar syntax. For each one (caret, tilde, wildcard, comparison, and multiple), try to come up with a use-case in which that particular kind of requirement makes sense. Caret requirements: It is used to update minor version and patch version. Tilde requirements: It is used to match the most recent patch version by freezing major version and minor version. Wildcard requirements: It is used to specify major version and accept any minor version and patch version. Both of comparison requirements and multiple requirements are used to give more control over packages. We may used them to overcome conflicts. Git can act as a simple CI system all by itself. In .git/hooks inside any git repository, you will find (currently inactive) files that are run as scripts when a particular action happens. Write a pre-commit hook that runs make paper.pdf and refuses the commit if the make command fails. This should prevent any commit from having an unbuildable version of the paper. After reading this tutorial above, You will find how git hooks work. So the solution will be ⬇️ Write a pre-commit hook in whatever languages you like. Here is my scipt. bash #!/usr/bin/env bash if ! make paper.pdf; then echo \"==\u003e Running make command fail :(\" exit 1 else echo \"==\u003e Running make command successfully :)\" exit 0 fi Change the file mode of hook you just wrote, make it executable. Type chmod u+x pre-commit in your terminal. mv the hook to .git/hooks. Type mv pre-commit .git/hooks/pre-commit Now it time to test if your hook works as you expected 🤗 ⬇️ bash \u003e git add . \u003e git commit -m \"Try to commit\" Set up a simple auto-published page using GitHub Pages.

Start a sleep 10000 job in a terminal, background it with Ctrl-Z and continue its execution with bg. Now use pgrep to find its pid and pkill to kill it without ever typing the pid itself. (Hint: use the -af flags). bash \u003e sleep 10000 # press Ctril-Z # output: [1] + 29705 suspended sleep 10000 \u003e bg %1 # output: [1] + 29705 continued sleep 10000 \u003e pgrep -af \"sleep\" # output: 29705 \u003e pkill -af \"sleep\" # output: [1] + 29705 terminated sleep 10000 Apparently, pgrep and pkill are quite handy. We won’t be bothered to find out the pid ourselves. Say you don’t want to start a process until another completes. How would you go about it? In this exercise, our limiting process will always be sleep 60 \u0026. One way to achieve this is to use the wait command. Try launching the sleep command and having an ls wait until the background process finishes. However, this strategy will fail if we start in a different bash session, since wait only works for child processes. One feature we did not discuss in the notes is that the kill command’s exit status will be zero on success and nonzero otherwise. kill -0 does not send a signal but will give a nonzero exit status if the process does not exist. Write a bash function called pidwait that takes a pid and waits until the given process completes. You should use sleep to avoid wasting CPU unnecessarily. We can use wait \u003cpid\u003e to wait for a process to complete before proceeding. Then the question is what is exactly the pid of sleep 60 \u0026. In last exercise, we know we can use pgrep to get the pid by process name. So the basic solution will be: bash \u003e sleep 60 \u0026 \u003e pgrep \"sleep\" | wait \u0026\u0026 ls However, the wait command is session-dependent. So we need to use kill -0. The pidwait() in pidwait.sh is like ⬇️ bash #!/bin/bash pidwait() { while kill -0 $1 2\u003e/dev/null # catch stderr to /dev/null do sleep 1 done ls } You can test like this ⬇️ bash \u003e source pidwait.sh \u003e sleep 60 \u0026 \u003e pidwait $(pgrep \"sleep\") ","date":"2021-12-27","objectID":"/en/exercise05-06-missingsemester-2020/:1:1","series":null,"tags":["Course","Bash","Git"],"title":"The solutions for exercise 05\u002606 of MIT.Missing-semester(2020)","uri":"/en/exercise05-06-missingsemester-2020/#job-control"},{"categories":["Course"],"content":" Terminal multiplexer Follow this tmux tutorial and then learn how to do some basic customizations following these steps Just follow the tutorial.

Version Control(git) If you don’t have any past experience with Git, either try reading the first couple chapters of Pro Git or go through a tutorial like Learn Git Branching. As you’re working through it, relate Git commands to the data model. :) Clone the repository for the class website Explore the version history by visualizing it as a graph. Who was the last person to modify README.md? (Hint: use git log with an argument). What was the commit message associated with the last modification to the collections: line of _config.yml?

Try adding a file to a repository, making some commits and then deleting that file from history (you may want to look at this). I made a new repo and made some commits. Finally I found the correct command to delete a file from all history 🤗 Ths command we are going to use is git filter-repo. If you haven’t installed it, you may just run brew install git filter-repo (for mac users). Then use this “magic” command do finish this exercise. bash \u003e git filter-repo --invert-paths --force --path \u003cfile\u003e The reason why I use --force is that git filter-repo refuses to overwrite my repo. It says my repo doesn’t look like a fresh clone. The mechanism behind this command is: --invert-paths will only select files matching none of options which we specify by --path. So it will keep everything except \u003cfile\u003e, and overwrite this commit history. Clone some repository from GitHub, and modify one of its existing files. What happens when you do git stash? What do you see when running git log --all --oneline? Run git stash pop to undo what you did with git stash. In what scenario might this be useful? I tried to modify README.md is the repo for the class website. Then I ran git stash. The output is: Saved working directory and index state WIP on master: c2f9535 Merge pull request #172 from chapmanjacobd/patch-1 text * 96cca4b (refs/stash) WIP on master: c2f9535 Merge pull request #172 from chapmanjacobd/patch-1 |\\ | * a95c46f index on master: c2f9535 Merge pull request #172 from chapmanjacobd/patch-1 |/ * c2f9535 (HEAD -\u003e master, origin/master, origin/HEAD) Merge pull request #172 from chapmanjacobd/patch-1 Then I ran git stash pop.

Data Wrangling Take this short interactive regex tutorial. Just click this link to finish this regex tutorial. Find the number of words (in /usr/share/dict/words) that contain at least three as and don’t have a 's ending. What are the three most common last two letters of those words? sed’s y command, or the tr program, may help you with case insensitivity. How many of those two-letter combinations are there? And for a challenge: which combinations do not occur? The answers of questions in exercise are ⬇️ Q: Find the number of words (in /usr/share/dict/words) that contain at least three as and don’t have a 's ending. Answer: tr 'A-Z' 'a-z' \u003c /usr/share/dict/words | grep -E '.*a.*a.*a.*[^s]$' | wc -l, 👉 5290 Use tr 'A-Z' 'a-z' \u003c /usr/share/dict/words to make text case-insensitive Use grep -E 'grep -E '.*a.*a.*a.*[^s]$' to find the words that contain at least three a and don’t have a 's ending The combination of .* means any character repeats any times. [s] will match the s character. We add a ^ in [], which mean we want to match any single character excepet s Use wc -l to count the number of lines in output. Q: What are the three most common last two letters of those words? A: tr 'A-Z' 'a-z' \u003c /usr/share/dict/words | grep -E '.*a.*a.*a.*[^s]$' | grep -E -o '.{2}$' | sort | uniq -c | sort | tail -n 1, 👉 1039 al and 763 an and 637 ae Use grep -E -o '.{2}$' to get last 2 letters of these words -o means Prints only the matching part of the lines. In this case, what we want is the last 2 letters, so we type .{2}$ Use sort | uniq -c to get the two-letter combinations count This can ensure the combinations are uniq. Use sort | tail -n 3 to sort previous results according to their frequency counts Q: How many of those two-letter combinations are there? A: tr 'A-Z' 'a-z' \u003c /usr/share/dict/words | grep -E '.*a.*a.*a.*[^s]$' | grep -E -o '.{2}$' | sort | uniq -c | wc -l, 👉 140 Q: And for a challenge: which combinations do not occur? bash diff \u003c(echo {a..z}{a..z} | tr \" \" \"\\n\") \\ \u003c(tr 'A-Z' 'a-z' \u003c /usr/share/dict/words | grep -E '.*a.*a.*a.*[^s]$' | grep -E -o '.{2}$' | sort | uniq -c | sort | awk '{print $2}' | sort) \\ | grep -E \"\u003c\" \\ | wc -l # output: 536 Use echo {a..z}{a..z} to get all two-letter combinations. However, in order to compare 2 sets of combinations(this one \u0026\u0026 Our previous results), we need to use \\n as delimiter of each combination. We can use tr \" \" \"\\n\". In the previous question, we can get every different combinations and their frequency counts. Each row looks like \u003cfrequency count\u003e combination. In order to get the combinations, we can use awk {print $2}, $2 means the second field in each row. After that, we need to Then we need a tool to compare the 2 sets of combinations. Here comes the diff command. diff will compare 2 files line by line. We also need Process substation to pass the 2 sets of combinations as arguments of diff To do in-place substitution it is quite tempting to do something like sed s/REGEX/SUBSTITUTION/ input.txt \u003e input.txt. However this is a bad idea, why? Is this particular to sed? Use man sed to find out how to accomplish this. This exercie remind me of the shellcheck tool. So I just type sed s/REGEX/SUBSTITUTION/ input.txt \u003e input.txt in a test.sh file and run shellcheck test.sh. Then I knew THIS IS A BAD IDEA. 📒 We should not read and write the same file in the same pipeline. After checking man sed carefully, I found 2 flags helpful–-i and -I. Both of them can edit file in-place. More information, you may check Find your average, median, and max system boot time over the last ten boots. Use bash journalctl on Linux and bash log show on macOS, and look for log timestamps near the beginning and end of each boot.

Shell Tools and Scripting write an ls command that lists files in the following manner Includes all files, including hidden files Sizes are listed in human readable format (e.g. 454M instead of 454279954) Files are ordered by recency Output is colorized A sample output would look like this bash -rw-r--r-- 1 user group 1.1M Jan 14 09:53 baz drwxr-xr-x 5 user group 160 Jan 14 09:53 . -rw-r--r-- 1 user group 514 Jan 14 06:42 bar -rw-r--r-- 1 user group 106M Jan 13 12:12 foo drwx------+ 47 user group 1.5K Jan 12 18:08 .. Interpretation Usually, the filename of hidden files are begin with ., we can use -a flag to include them. If you want to list sizes in human readable format, use -lh According to the man ls，-t means the output are sort by descending time modified (most recently modified first) In order to enable colorized output, use -G So the solution is⬇️ bash \u003e ls -a -lh -t -G Write bash functions marco and polo that do the following. Whenever you execute marco the current working directory should be saved in some manner, then when you execute polo, no matter what directory you are in, polo should cd you back to the directory where you executed marco. For ease of debugging you can write the code in a file marco.sh and (re)load the definitions to your shell by executing source marco.sh. The marco.sh⬇️ I store the output of pwd in ~/pwd.txt file. bash #!/bin/bash marco() { touch ~/pwd.txt pwd \u003e\u003e ~/pwd.txt } The poli.sh⬇️ Just use cat ~/pwd.txt to get the origin working directory. bash #!/bin/bash poli() { destination=$(cat ~/pwd.txt) cd \"$destination\" || exit } Quick test⬇️ bash \u003e source marco.sh \u003e source poli.sh \u003e marco \u003e cd .. # you can cd wherever you want \u003e poli # now you will go back to origin working directory 📒 I highly recommend the shellcheck tool. Use it to check your *.sh file after you have finished your code. Say you have a command that fails rarely. In order to debug it you need to capture its output but it can be time consuming to get a failure run. Write a bash script that runs the following script until it fails and captures its standard output and error streams to files and prints everything at the end. Bonus points if you can also report how many runs it took for the script to fail. bash #!/usr/bin/env bash n=$(( RANDOM % 100 )) if [[ n -eq 42 ]]; then echo \"Something went wrong\" \u003e\u00262 echo \"The error was using magic numbers\" exit 1 fi echo \"Everything went according to plan\" The meaning of this script is judge if a random number(n) equal 42 or not. The random number ranges from 0 to 99, so we may need to run many many time until we get a 42. In order to debug this *.sh file, we can measure how many times we run this *.sh. Apparently, we can use do-while loop, which corresponds to until-loop in bash. I found this Link helpful. The solution is(test.sh)⬇️ bash #!/bin/bash count=0 # run random.sh until it goes wrong until [[ \"$?\" -ne 0 ]];do # $? will return the exit status of the most recently executed command count=$((count + 1)) bash ./random.sh \u0026\u003e result.txt # \u0026 means we run the random.sh in the background. done echo \"Error dectected: $count runs\" cat result.txt Quick test⬇️ bash \u003e bash test.sh As we covered in the lecture find’s -exec can be very powerful for performing operations over the files we are searching for. However, what if we want to do something with all the files, like creating a zip file? As you have seen so far commands will take input from both arguments and STDIN. When piping commands, we are connecting STDOUT to STDIN, but some commands like tar take inputs from arguments. To bridge this disconnect there’s the xargs command which will execute a command using STDIN as arguments. For example ls | xargs rm will delete the files in the current directory. Your task is to write a command that recursively finds all HTML files in the folder and makes a zip with them. Note that your command should work even if the files have spaces (hint: check -d flag for xargs).
